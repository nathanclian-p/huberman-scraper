Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. We are now live today with our annual and lifetime members of the Huberman Lab podcast Premium channel. First off, I just want to welcome everyone. Thanks so much for being here. I hope you're having a good holidays, and I'll wish you a happy new year at this point, and again, at the end.
Starting point is 00:00:34
I want to kick off our discussion today by just highlighting some of the incredible things that you all have already done. The Premium Channel, as most of of you presumably know, provides support for important research. And when I say important research, we can define that as research that is done on humans with humans with their consent, of course, that we believe stands the highest probability of leading to new quality treatments and improvements in mental health, physical health, and performance. So support from the premium channel, that is from you, has already allowed us to make
Starting point is 00:01:12
several substantial gifts to various laboratories as well as some other endeavors. So I'll just quickly tell you where those funds have gone, and then I'll tell you something really, truly exciting about where we're headed in 2024. We'll get to the questions in a moment but I think this is important to hear. First of all we made a year-long gift and when I say year-long gift we're talking gifts that I certainly can say from my perspective as a researcher who's run a laboratory for a very long time. These are the size gifts that allow researchers to do research that they otherwise would not have been able to do. They pay salaries, they pay for materials in the laboratory, they pay for the sorts of things that allow science to happen that would not otherwise happen.
Starting point is 00:01:56
We made a gift to Dr. Alia Crums laboratory at Stanford in the Department of Psychology. She studies mindsets. Some of you may have seen the episode with Ali, as she's called, Dr. Crum on the Hebrew and Lab podcast. She's studying mindsets and how they affect both mental health and physical health in children and adults. And that work hopefully will get a report back on at some point soon about how those mindsets can improve performance in school work, athletics,
Starting point is 00:02:24
and other areas of life. So the idea here is that you supported that work through the premium channel. And then that work can happen, and then we can get the information about what the conclusions of that work are, out into the general population, meaning into the public, so that people can benefit from that knowledge right away, and in many cases implement that knowledge. We also made a gift to Dr. Sachin Pandit, the Saul Institute for Biological Studies, Sachin Pandit is an expert in circadian biology and intermittent fasting.
Starting point is 00:02:50
And the study he is using those funds for relates to intermittent fasting as a specific tool for improving mental health. We also made a gift to Dr. Carla Schatz and at Stanford University School of Medicine. She's studying how the immune system and maternal conditions, and especially infections, or various kinds that pregnant women sometimes encounter or get, can affect the developing fetal brain.
Starting point is 00:03:17
That work also relates to stem cells. I know there's a lot of excitement about stem cells nowadays, so I'll give you an update on that as soon as I can. We also made a substantial gift to Dr. Joanna Steinglas at Columbia University School of Medicine. Dr. Steinglas has not yet been on the podcast, but hopefully she will have time to come on the podcast at some point soon.
Starting point is 00:03:34
She's studying and developing novel treatments for eating disorders. If you didn't see the episode on healthy and disordered eating, sadly, anorexia neurosa is the most deadly of all the psychiatric conditions. That is a great number of patients that have inter-exe-narosa, unfortunately, go on to die of malnourishment and things related to malnourishment.
Starting point is 00:03:56
So it's a critical, critical issue that's not talked about enough and frankly is not well funded enough at the level of federal funding, but through your support, there's now funding. Siphoning into her laboratory, and she's directing those funds directly at novel treatments, based on neuroscience and habit formation for eating disorders, anorexia, and other eating disorders. Dr. Nolan Williams also at Stanford, who does work on transcranial magnext stimulation, which is a tool to non-invasively altered neural circuits in the brain for purposes of relieving depression and PTSD and excitingly
Starting point is 00:04:31
Dr. Williams laboratory also combines TMS transcranial magnext stimulation with psychedelic treatments in particular I began but also psilocybin There's a lot of excitement about that and then last but certainly not least We also funded a chronobiology conference. They were aside, and there's a lot of excitement about that. And then last but certainly not least, we also funded a chronobiology conference. They were desperate for funds reached out, and we were delighted to provide the funds for that conference. Those funds allowed graduate students and postdocs who come from laboratories that couldn't afford to send those students
Starting point is 00:05:01
and postdocs to that conference, to attend that conference. And I must say from a lot of years of experience in the scientific community, the ability to attend these high-quality meetings is absolutely critical for those young scientists to be able to glean important information and go back to their own laboratories and to make novel contributions. It also can be the difference between a new collaboration getting sparked up or not. And I should just mention that the research laboratories that we fund were at a much higher level than the conferences, but the conferences I think are also a really important way to direct funds.
Starting point is 00:05:34
For those of you that don't know, chronobiology is how the timing of light temperature and exercise and eating affect health. So all things that I think people are interested in. So that's it for what we covered and what we supported in 2023. We're very proud of the support that we were able to provide thanks to your help.
Starting point is 00:05:51
And I am very, very excited to announce that, while in 2023, it was Sycom Us, the human law podcast through your premium channel support that allows us to make that support. And we had a matching donation, dollar for dollar donation from the tiny foundation heading into 2024, tiny foundation is going to continue to do a dollar, a dollar for dollar match, excuse me,
Starting point is 00:06:12
which is exciting. And we've brought on in addition to that, two other donors who are going to also do dollar for dollar donation. So in other words, for every dollar that the Huberman Lab premium channel has or raises in 2024, there will be $3 to match that. So this is phenomenal.
Starting point is 00:06:29
And what it means is that the Sci-Com and the Hubertman Lab podcasts are now doing what's considered on University campuses as major philanthropy. So very exciting. And so thank you also very much for your support. You are making a difference in the research. And I don't just say that. I know anytime there's funderasers, things that sort, by the way this is not a fund eraser, this is us saying thank you to you, but it's
Starting point is 00:06:51
always hard to know where those funds go and we make sure that the whole process is a very streamlined, we cut the fat on the on in every dimension so that the money can go to discovering new tools for mental health physical health and performance. So thank you so much. Okay, first question is up. Carolyn A. writes, I am interested in studies about the anterior mid-singulate cortex. Oh, yes, such an interesting structure.
Starting point is 00:07:17
Would you please share any information regarding those? Thank you for all you do in the advancement side. Thank you for all you do in the advancement of science. Carolyn and others listening. Okay, so the anterior mid-singular cortex for those of you that may not have seen the episode on willpower and tenacity, but even if you have, is a region of the brain that is involved in leaning into difficult challenges of all kinds. This is an area of the brain that gets larger when we embrace
Starting point is 00:07:46
effort that leads to a bit of internal anxiety, but it's something that's good for us, an adaptive thing. And this is an area of the brain that gets smaller when we don't engage in challenging endeavors. Now, we need to define challenging endeavors, very specifically, challenging endeavors that stimulate the growth of the anterior mid-singulate cortex or challenging endeavors that we would prefer not to do. We may want the end goal, right, so we may want the consequence of the exercise, the consequence of the learning, the consequence of whatever the challenge is, but that the challenge itself feels uncomfortable. And here, of course, we want it to be uncomfortable, but safe challenges is what is what's
Starting point is 00:08:23
going to grow the anterior midmidsingulate cortex. Now, another thing about the inter-midsingulate cortex that's important is that for people that end up being successful, diet, or successful pursuit of fitness for people that complete a degree or finish an exam or things that sort of the inter-midsingulate cortex is bigger. For people that fail to do the work required to prepare,
Starting point is 00:08:44
so the preparation, that is, the entry-mitsing lit cortex actually shows a bit of atrophy. So the entry-mitsing lit cortex is an anatomical and neural reflection of willpower and tenacity. And I think what people get wrong over and over about these sorts of findings is that the entry-mitsing lit cortex is really responding to a variety of inputs as a lot of different inputs and outputs. We know that based on neural circuit tracing, but it absolutely responds best to things that feel like that they are indeed difficult, that they are challenged. So if you're like me and you enjoy certain forms of exercise and it's just pure bliss
Starting point is 00:09:20
for you the whole way through, that's not going to grow your anterior mid-singulate cortex. However, if you add a bit of, let's say, higher intensity work, I like doing a long run or hike on Sundays. I don't do sprints too often at the end of that. But if I were to do a couple of hill sprints at the end and I really was like, ah, this is rough, this sucks. That's actually the sort of thing that's going to stimulate the anterior mid-singulate cortex. The anterior mid-singulate cortex,
Starting point is 00:09:43
since Carolyn, you asked about studies, was actually discovered in cases where people were stimulating the sprain area and the subjects, these were people receiving neurosurgery for other reasons, reported feeling like something was impending, some not impending doom, but there was some challenge, like they were gonna head into a storm,
Starting point is 00:10:02
something challenging was coming, but the other subjective feeling that they reported was, feeling like they could lean into it, like they're going to head into a storm, something challenging was coming, but the other subjective feeling that they reported was feeling like they could lean into it, like they're ready for, they're ready to meet that challenge. So what you're looking for when you are interested in growing your interimid-singulate cortex, and I'll tell you why that's a good thing to do,
Starting point is 00:10:17
is you're looking for that feeling of leaning into challenge, that friction, if something's too easy or it's too delightful, that's not going to contribute to your intermittent single-lit cortex function and growth. It might contribute to other things, indeed it will, and life isn't all about leaning into challenge, but why would you want to stimulate your intermittent single-lit cortex in this way? And by the way, those challenges can come from physical endeavors, they can come from
Starting point is 00:10:40
language learning, it can come from a hard conversation that you've been putting off that's hard for you to have. Lord knows we all, I'll have those aspects of our lives and things that we're putting off that are hard for us or that feel difficult. Again, keep these endeavor safe. Never wanna do anything that would damage your mental health or physical health. But leaning into challenge in that way
Starting point is 00:10:59
does seem to activate and grow the enter mid-singulate cortex. Now, the advantages of that is that there are studies, excuse me, showing that the so-called super-agers, the super-agers, I don't like that name so much, it's a bit of a misnomer, they call them super-agers, but they really should be called super-non-agers because these are people who seem to maintain healthy cognitive function much longer than most individuals. Their memory, their IQ, is remain stable into their much, much later decades of their life,
Starting point is 00:11:29
or even improves over time. And then the correlation, and again, this is correlation, but these people's interimidcingly cortex does not atrophy, and in general, what the studies point to, and there's still, needs to be more data collected on this, is that these people are regularly engaging in things that are hard for them and challenging challenging and they've embraced that challenge.
Starting point is 00:11:47
So lots to say about Interim It's Inuit Cortex, but I think that grabs the top contour. And I'm a big fan of trying to do something difficult, at least one thing, ideally every week. And perhaps even every day, a little bit, it doesn't take much. Maybe even just five minutes, It's that friction that feeling, oh, I don't want to do this. I can't do this. And then continuing to practice or continuing to lean
Starting point is 00:12:10
into that challenge safely, of course, that is going to grow that interimid signaling cortex. And I just think that's amazing, right? We hear so much about brain naotrophy and memory loss and et cetera, et cetera, as we get older, a lot of data now about how to preserve healthy physical function. Here we're really talking about how to maintain healthy cognitive function and the interim and seeing late cortex seems to be a barometer of how well we are doing that.
Starting point is 00:12:32
Mark S asks, would love to hear more about an evening routine and not just morning, especially when it comes to light. Oh, I love this question. I love this question because I've made a lot of changes in the last year related to this because there's this guy on the internet that talks about the importance of getting morning sunlight just kidding. There are several of us but end gals but I suppose I've been quite vocal about the importance of getting morning sunlight as soon as possible after waking and of course of course of course unless you have powers I'm not aware of if you wake up before the sun comes out, if you
Starting point is 00:13:02
always ask what do I do, You wait till the sun comes out. If it's overcast, you get outside a bit longer. If you want to wake up before the sun comes out, turn on bright artificial lights. Now these days I've actually been playing around a little bit with some bright artificial lights before I, because I tend to wake up before the sun is out. It's the winter months.
Starting point is 00:13:18
But in any case, I've talked a lot about the morning routine in the early part of the day and a bit about the afternoon part of the day. Evening routine. Okay, well, I'll tell you ideal and then I'll tell you what I do. I'm always shooting for ideal, but I'm human. I think there's this idea on the internet that I've seen that my whole life is protocols, protocol, protocol, protocol, and indeed.
Starting point is 00:13:42
Sometimes it looks like that and indeed sometimes it doesn't. I'm human, things happen. We all encounter different challenges. So to answer your question directly, Mark, I think it's, I know it's very important that if possible that you get a little splash of sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon and evening, why? Why is that important?
Starting point is 00:14:02
And what we're really talking about here is not necessarily seeing the sunset at the beach, although that would be great if you could do that, but getting some sunlight in your eyes before the sun goes down, maybe for five, 10 minutes. It's not as important as the morning sunlight, but it does have a great benefit. And the benefit is it adjusts the sensitivity of the neurons in your retinine and your brain such that it protects you against brighter artificial lights later in the evening.
Starting point is 00:14:26
Now, it doesn't protect you completely, but what it does is if normally, and this is true, bright light viewed for 15 seconds or more between the hours of 10 pm and 4 am, I'm talking about somebody on a standard schedule, not shift worker, bright lights viewed for 15 seconds or more between the hours of 10 pm and 4 am can dramatically quash melatonin levels. Melatonin being the hormone that's involved in feeling sleepy and falling asleep. It does other things as well. Of course, it's secretive from the pineal. We know based on a really nice study published in science reports that if you view that afternoon, late afternoon, evening sunlight, you don't have to be too strict about the time, get, you know, pop your
Starting point is 00:15:08
sunglasses off as long as you can do that safely, get some sunlight in your eyes or if you can't look directly at the sun, and by the way, never stare directly at the sun, at least getting some daylight in your eyes before the sun goes down, that can offset that melatonin reduction by about 50-50%, which is pretty impressive. Now you would still do well to dim the lights in the evening, and one thing that I've been playing with recently is using red lights. So a lot of people, when they hear red lights, they think, oh, you're talking about red light panel, which that has its use, is those tend to be very bright red lights, or portable
Starting point is 00:15:44
red light. I actually use a small portable red light. It looks like a thick piece of toast. I use that for other reasons. This is not what we're talking about with evening routine, with evening routine. It can be beneficial and very, very cost effective to get some red bulbs and put them in, say, the bedroom where you read before you go to sleep
Starting point is 00:16:03
or in a particular room in your house, you tend to spend time in the evening. Makes for a nice mellow feel, but it also does several other things. First of all, if they're the correct red bulbs, and I'll mention the ones that I've been using in a moment, they eliminate all the blue wavelengths that tend to be stimulating for the, what we call the NOR adjunctive system, so adrenaline, nor adrenaline, cortisol, et cetera. Indeed, there's a study that shows that when shift workers who have to be up at night
Starting point is 00:16:32
use red lights of the type that I'm describing, when they work under red light, they have less of a cortisol increase than where they to work under standard fluorescent lights or even standard LED lights. So number one thing would be dim the lights in the evening and at night as much as you safely can to perform whatever functions you need. Don't fall, you know, don't burn yourself with the stove. You know, if you have to ride and do work as I often do, you need light. But to the extent that you can shift to red lights, that can be helpful.
Starting point is 00:16:59
And many people, many people in myself included find that you get sleepier when you do that. So I might just do this for the last hour of the evening, even if I'm up till 10 or 11. Or if I do it earlier, then I tend to get really sleepy. But those red lights, you know, I have a little lamp above my bed. I'll do that if I'm going to read in bed. I make it much easier fall asleep probably because of the reduced cortisol associated with eliminating the blue wavelengths. And they tend to be fairly dim. And now there's one brand of red light that you actually can, that actually will work on a dimmer.
Starting point is 00:17:30
So this is important. I suppose you could use a red party lights or Christmas lights. Those could be very affordable. Some people do that and put it kind of festive feel in the room. Other people like myself will use a red light that's dimmable. I want to mention that what I'm about to say, I don't have any financial relationship Like myself, we'll use a red light that's dimmable. I wanna mention that what I'm about to say, I don't have any financial relationship to this company
Starting point is 00:17:49
in terms of the bulbs. Red light panels are different. I use the Juve type, but for red lights that for the purpose I'm talking about, that would go into a standard lamp and that you dim, where that's a very different purpose, right? The red light panels have a very different purpose than red bulbs that you would put into a standard light fixture.
Starting point is 00:18:07
The dimmable ones are called, you can find them as red light and just put bond. It's the technical name of the company is, sorry, forgive me for Googling this now. Yeah, it's a bond charge, B-O-N, separate word charge. And those are dimmable and they have the proper wavelength. So that's what I use. They're not super cheap, but they're not expensive either in comparison to most red light therapies or something. So we're not talking about red light therapy. We're talking about reducing the overall amount
Starting point is 00:18:39
of blue light in your environment, et cetera. Now, for many people who don't want to purchase something new, and again, I have no financial relationship to bond charge So, I don't clean any thing. I buy them with my own money. And I just have one or two of them, and I dim the lights, even those red lights I dim while I'm reading it night and then fall asleep. If you don't want to use red lights for whatever reason, then you would be wise to just dim the lights that you have, and where possible to have those lights be set fairly low in your room environment. Now, why would that be? Okay, well, first of all, the cells that activate the alertness system in the brain via the retina, your eye, tend to look up into your environment.
Starting point is 00:19:16
And that makes sense because they're essentially there to view sunlight and the presence or absence of sunlight. But in addition to that, think about it logically. If I take a flashlight and I shine a beam on the ground or at a tree in the yard, it looks very bright. But you're not getting all those photons in your eyes, you're seeing it at a distance. As opposed to shining the light in your eyes,
Starting point is 00:19:37
it's very, very bright. So when you have lights that are overhead and going into your eyes, it's very different than the light being on the floor or on a surface. This gets back to something that I often get asked, how could it be that viewing sunlight through a window takes 50 times longer to activate your circadian system than it does when you step outside? Let's think about that.
Starting point is 00:19:56
When you step outside, there's sunlight everywhere. If you face the sun, there's even more coming at you. But when you're inside, unless there's a beam of light coming through that window and the window is very clear or open for that matter, you're not really getting the light in your eyes in the same way that if you're outside with the sunlight in your eyes, right? It's the same thing as looking at a beam of light from a flashlight against a wall versus the beam of light going at your eyes, okay? So we talked about dimming the lights, setting them low in the room, it's not red light
Starting point is 00:20:22
therapy, but changing over to red lights. Bond charge is probably just one of many out there. I've seen it done pretty nicely with just somebody, people grab red party lights, go on, whatever your favorite search engine, sales side, and you'll have red lights, and you can do that. That's gonna be better than any blue lights.
Starting point is 00:20:37
And then if you're gonna be on your screens, here's what I suggest, is a short cut function in your phone, where you can triple click to switch your phone over to eliminate all the blues. This is very different than just using the nighttime function, very different. And I think we should probably put out a video on how to do this. But what you do is you go into the accessibility function on your phone, you go into color filters and then you drag down the blues.
Starting point is 00:21:02
But that's not how your phone is going to be set all day, because then you don't see anything that's in blue. But you can introduce a triple-click function. I'll put out a clip soon on how to do that. So when I go to sleep at night or in the evening, what I'll do is I'll triple-click and I'll switch my phone over to red only. And that's completely zero cost, by the way, it doesn't cost anything. And then in the morning, when I wake up, I click, click, click, and turn on, although I try and get the sunlight in my eyes before I look at my phone. Okay, Tom M
Starting point is 00:21:27
asks, light therapy recommendations for those that live in northern regions with limited morning light or too cold to get outside for morning light. Dark one waking. Do red light therapy? Great question. I'm going to take a sip of this bone broth because at the rate I'm speaking, if I try and keep this up for an hour and a half, I might get a little horse. Red light therapy is different than what I just described. Red light therapy is the use of red light panels. It can be smaller panels, like the small jove that I use, which is a unit about the size
Starting point is 00:21:56
of a piece. I guess they call it Texas toast, right? It's a Texas thick piece of toast. Maybe someone knows why it's called Texas toast. I guess it's big. It's about the size of a piece of toast. It provides very bright red light. And in between those red lights on there, there tends to be near infrared light. So far red. So, you know, to a biologist, red doesn't mean as much as the wavelength of light. So wavelength something like the 650 to 800 nanometers is what we're talking about.
Starting point is 00:22:27
Whereas blue light is down in the, you know, four and five hundred and really like five thirty five to, you know, low sixes, you know, like the rainbow, right? Red or green, green blue. There are also larger red light panels and nowadays I also see a lot of advertisements for red light panels. You can actually light down in red light panels. And nowadays I also see a lot of advertisements for red light panels. You actually like down in red light beds. Here's the story. Red light will often be marketed as the most powerful, the most intensity, the most locks. Most important is the proper wavelengths or are the proper wavelengths. So that's why I use the Juve because Juve has the proper wavelengths of red and far red. The distance to view a red light of that sort generally is about 18 inches. Sometimes a little closer.
Starting point is 00:23:11
Now sometimes people will put red light on different parts of their body. I covered a bit of this in the light and health episode, but red light because it's longer wavelength light can permeate through tissues to fairly substantial depth. How deep depends on the tissue. If you put it up against your skull, is it gonna get down into your brain? No, it's not gonna get through your skull. Maybe a little bit, if it's a very high powered red light,
Starting point is 00:23:32
if you're holding a red light of that power at home, something's wrong. I don't, that's a medical device. However, Juve are medical grade red light and near and for red lights. And they are quite powerful. They're the right wavelengths. Actually, that's why I prefer Juve
Starting point is 00:23:47
because they are medical grade. They can be directed at your eyes in the morning for the purpose of, there's a study out of two studies, actually out of Glenn Jeffery's laboratory at the University of College, London, showing that viewing red lights at a distance of about 18 inches or so in the morning for people who are over 40 but not for people younger by the way.
Starting point is 00:24:10
That can offset some of the age-related reductions in mitochondrial function and vision loss. So I look at a red light in this due, my juve Texas toast light or I have a juve panel. At a distance of about, I confess I stand about 12 to 18 inches away. And I do not force myself to look at that light. I don't hold my eyelids open. I allow myself to blink, so I'm comfortable. Truth told you, you could probably close your eyelids and some of that red light is going to get through your eyelids. Not a ton, but some.
Starting point is 00:24:41
So no problem blinking. You never, ever, ever want to look at any light. Sunlight or otherwise, red light, any light. So bright that's painful to look at. If you have to blink, it's too bright. Step back. If you have to blink every once in a while, that's okay. But if you have to blink in order to close your eyes
Starting point is 00:24:56
in order to protect your eyes, then you're standing too close. In the morning, you can do red light therapy on skin, you can do it on eyes. Will it wake your system up? Will it provide the kind of cortisol increase, which by the way you want early in the day and adrenaline and dopamine increase that sunlight can provide? The answer is no. Sunlight is unique in that way.
Starting point is 00:25:16
However, if you live in an area of the world that's too dark or you wake up long before you get sunlight in your eyes, what can you do? Well, you can flip on artificial lights. You do that the opposite of how I recommend in the evening. You'd want to flip on overhead lights as bright as possible. If you have the disposable income and you want to invest in a 10,000 lux light panel or a 900 lux light panel,
Starting point is 00:25:38
again, I have no financial relationship to these companies, but there's a light panel 900 lux drawing tablet that I've set on my desk for a number of years recently. I confess I've started experimenting with some of the 10,000 lux light panels that sit on your desk. Excuse me, those are very, very bright, and I do use that now if I wake up really early and I'm going to do some work, I'll turn that thing on and it sure wakes you up. Now, is it as good as sunlight? No, it doesn't have the right color features and alternation between yellow and blue that morning sunlight has and that evening sunlight has. And without doing a whole tutorial, when the sun is low in the sky, so-called low solar
Starting point is 00:26:15
angle sunlight, you'll know it's if you take a picture with your phone, it provides not a cloudy day. You'll see that there's a lot of blue, yellow contrast. And that's the optimal stimulus. That said, if it's overcast out, you should still get outside because some of those wavelengths are coming through even though you can't perceive the blue in the yellow. So you could get a 10,000 looks light, but if you can't afford that or you don't want to, oh, and by the way, those you set
Starting point is 00:26:37
on your desk, you turn on for five, 10 minutes while you're making coffee or things like that. So they actually recommend that you don't keep them on too much. Some people actually can feel a little too euphoric and maybe even get a little headache because it's a lot of blue light. So that's one thing. The other thing you can do is that if you can't access light of any kind, it's a dark, dark dark. That's where the cold shower really can help because you get that adrenaline bump early
Starting point is 00:26:58
in the day, which is good. So early in the day, you know, provided you're not going into states of anxiety as a consequence of it, getting adrenaline, dopamine, cortisol increases is great. And then as the day goes on in the evening and nighttime, certainly you want to taper the levels of those neurochemicals off. Now, of course, there's always going to be some cortisol. There's always going to be some epinephrine. There always be dopamine in your system.
Starting point is 00:27:18
If you go out dancing, you go to a party at night, should you worry about the lights? No. Okay, I am not, despite what you might presume or here or read, I am not this sort of person who wears sunglasses in a party. Although the other day I was at a party and someone was wearing sunglasses, I think it was for other reasons. The, the, the, that, that gives the impression that was something bad going on. I think they were just like looking cool, by the way. And they did look cool, but I don't do that. And if I drive at night, I don't wear sunglasses.
Starting point is 00:27:47
I do, and I have been exploring the use of blue light filter glasses in the evening and those red lights in my house, but for I think for most people, if you get out every once in a while, you go out to a late night, you go out dancing, you have a party with friends, you know, you get home, dim the lights,
Starting point is 00:28:01
maybe use those red lights, get to sleep. Early in the day, bright lights, ideally, from sunlight, bright, bright, bright, bright, bright, how bright as bright as possible. And as many as you as reasonable, except to the extent that it could damage your eyes, so don't be staring at any bright lights excessively. Okay. I think that pretty much summarizes it. And then of course, early day, it's really about sunlight or light of other kinds. Cold water, if that's your thing, if that's not your thing, that's really about sunlight or light of other kinds, cold water if that's your thing, if that's not your thing, that's fine. There was no tablet that descended down to us telling us
Starting point is 00:28:30
that we had to get into cold water each day. It's an option, it's all an option. Dennis from Munich. I love Munich. I've been there in a while, but I used to go and mocksplunking Munich for a number of times per year and I miss the food, I miss the Schnitzel. As we approach a new year, what health and fitness metrics do you recommend checking? Oh, good one. And could you share your annual medical fitness check routine? Okay.
Starting point is 00:28:59
What I'm about to say, I'm sure, will generally jive with what Dr. Peter Atia, who I'm sure will generally jive with what Dr. Peter Atia, who I'm sure you all know, and who I respect tremendously, also grateful to Kalma close friend. Basically, asserts is important for fitness. I think if you're going to do a fitness test, you know, Peter's got it in mind and I generally agree, you know, you deadlift your body weight 10 times in the same set, hang from a bar for a minute or more, okay, in the same set. These sorts of things. I tend to be far less PE class about it, frankly. My goal is always the same.
Starting point is 00:29:41
48 years old, I've been doing the same training program ever since I was 16. More or less, I mean I've had you know peaks and valleys in terms of my consistency based on other obligations and of course when I'm sick I don't train. Sick people stay out of gyms please. Nothing makes me more frustrated than people showing up to get their workout and getting everybody sick. Here's the deal. I try to be capable. That is ready for various things. What? The ability to go on a long hike.
Starting point is 00:30:13
What's a long hike? Five to 10 miles with some hills. The ability to sprint for the airplane without blowing a gasket. The ability, or that means hurting oneself or having a heart attack. The ability to carry some heavy furniture with assistance safely or God forbid to take a trip and not damage myself. And of course to have some level of agility and coordination. So how does one do that? So what help fitness metrics do I recommend checking? Well, I'm going to do this next week because it's the end of the year, but pretty much every week it's the following three cardiovascular
Starting point is 00:30:50
training sessions. One is long, meaning an hour to 90 minutes. That's going to be slow for me. So this could be a weighted hike. So a weight vested hike, or you could just put some weight in a backpack, or just be a hike if it's really steep, or a long, slow jog. Once a week, for me, it's jogging or hiking for other people cycling or swimming. Sometime in the middle of week, I'm doing a 35 minute run. So maybe five minutes of warm up and then a faster 35 minute run. You could also do it on a row or you could also do it on bike, but you're really pushing up around, I don't know, maybe I don't tend to measure heart rate, but
Starting point is 00:31:23
where it's, I could not hold a conversation. I'm working, I'm working, I'm not sprinting, but I'm working. And then another time during the week, a shorter workout of about 12 minutes, it's going to be three minutes of warm-up, some calisthenics, a little bit of cycling on an assault bike or something, that sort of assault bikes are the ones where you have the handles with the fan, work of the arrow, or it could be any sprinting a hill and then doing it sometimes one minute on one minute off for 12 minutes, sometimes doing 20 seconds on 10 seconds off for eight rounds and it's real work.
Starting point is 00:31:53
It's getting the heart rate all the way up VO2 max. The combination of those three types of cardiovascular training sessions are that I'm ready to sprint for the airplane. I'm ready to take a long hike anytime. I can go out for a two mile run and really enjoy that if I need to. It's a readiness thing. And I think it covers all bases.
Starting point is 00:32:10
Am I ever going to be a marathoner or a champion sprinter with that or a myler? No, but that's not my goal. And it never has been. I ran a cross-country race in high school and we'll tell that story another time. It was a lot of fun until I hit the second mile. The other thing I do three times a week is I work out with resistance training.
Starting point is 00:32:31
I train my legs one day, so that's calves, hamstrings, quads. I train my torso, so that's, I do some pushing for my shoulders and upper chest, some dips, that kind of thing, some pull-ups, some rowing, the sort of thing. I train my neck because I'm a big believer in that for the upper spine, but don't go at it heavy. It's just really to maintain posture and to make sure that upper spine is supported, something that most people neglect.
Starting point is 00:32:56
And then one day a week, I do smaller body parts. Like I'll do my, train my calves again, biceps triceps. I'll make sure that if there are any small body parts that happen to mistor in the middle of the week because of scheduling like rear delts or something, I'll do that maybe a little bit more neck work or some ab work. Okay. Those are spread out about a day apart. I don't get too obsessed with the spacing between those workouts, but they're not all stacked against one another. So it might be, in my case, it's, it's long run on Sunday. This is just how I do it. Monday tends to be off.
Starting point is 00:33:26
Excuse me, long run on Sunday or hike. Monday is legs. Excuse me. Monday is always legs. Tuesday off, Wednesday. I generally would do that shorter run or the torso work. I flip flop them depending on how my legs are feeling. And the next day I do whatever I need to do either the torso,
Starting point is 00:33:42
resistance training or the 35 minute run. And then Fridays that faster clip cardio, Saturday tends to be the smaller body parts, biceps triceps, etc. I must say these days of the week always have the ability to slide one way or the other. So for instance, if I'm traveling and I don't get back on Sunday until late, if I was not able to do that training while I was on the road, then I will do it on Monday, and then I'll just slide things around so that I finish off the week with everything done, and I can get back on schedule.
Starting point is 00:34:12
But the way I've arranged it, everybody pockets it twice, once directly, once indirectly, and the cardiovascular training is covers all bases. Why train this way? Well, it ensures strength, it ensures whatever aesthetic changes you want, you can emphasize working harder and more sets, perhaps for the things that you want to bring up certain body parts that are weaker. You can certainly recover because you're only training legs once a week, but guess what? You're doing them on Monday and you're sprinting on Friday, so they're getting hit indirectly on Friday, even if it's on the bike, that fast
Starting point is 00:34:43
hard pedaling with resistance is going to make sure that your legs aren't going to atrophy, you can still get butt, you can still train them again on Monday again. So this schedule is designed in a very specific way. None of the workouts except the longer workout on Sunday, that jogger runner's longer than an hour. Ever.
Starting point is 00:35:01
It's 10 minutes of warm up in 50, 5, 0 minutes of work in the gym, sometimes 60. Sometimes I'll truncate to 45 or 40 if I'm really, I have a bunch of things going on. So this sort of schedule sounds like a lot, but it's not. It's actually a very small investment, it's about an hour a day and not even on Tuesday, which is a rest day. So what are the metrics that I recommend checking? Well, I'm a big believer that if you're sleeping well and your your appetite is consistent, and you're feeling generally good, that's an
Starting point is 00:35:28
important metric. It's a very subjective metric, but that's important. Are you sleeping well? Are you waking up sore and you're not able to recover? Are you feeling like no matter how much sleep you get, you can't feel rested, these kinds of things. Now there could be other factors involved, but that's the, you know, sort of a basic one. The other one is how much energy and pepper you bring into your workouts, that's important. And it relates to caffeine and fueling and all those sorts of things, which we're not talking about right now.
Starting point is 00:35:50
It's far too much to talk about here, but we did cover in the foundational fitness protocol. By the way, all of this is put into a PDF that's available online at HubermanLab.com, zero cost. Simply go to the newsletter tab under the menu, and you can scroll down, find the foundational fitness protocol, get into sets and reps and loads and all that kind of stuff, completely zero cost. I do take my morning resting pulse rate.
Starting point is 00:36:14
I know what my pulse rate ought to be. If it's elevated substantially and I'm not particularly stressed about something, then I might pay attention to that and back off a little bit in the intensity on things. If I have a throat tickler, I'm not feeling very well. I'm really careful about working out. Sometimes I'll do it, sometimes I won't. I'll make sure that isn't just some sort of like dust or allergen in the environment,
Starting point is 00:36:32
but if I'm feeling under the weather, I'll just skip. I just skip that workout. And some people go, oh, you'll skip because you're, you know, I'll be honest. I'm 48, I'm training very consistently. I am fortunately, knock on wood, a little bit suspicious. Knock on wood, I'm training very consistently. I am fortunately, Nakhamwood, a little bit suspicious. Nakhamwood, I have avoided major injuries. I've been able to train consistently.
Starting point is 00:36:51
And I also don't tend to succumb to colds and flu. I think about once every 18 to 24 months, I've had a colder flu of some sort. For many years, that's been the kind of cadence, but not more frequent than that. I think in part, because I don't tend to push really hard when I'm sick, I tend to be the guy who goes, all right, I'm feeling kind of under the weather, should I train, maybe not, okay, I'm gonna take a hot shower and get in bed at 6 p.m.,
Starting point is 00:37:12
reading, go to sleep. If I wake up at 3 a.m. because I went to bed too early, just chillin' bed and read, maybe fall back asleep, maybe not. I think taking care of oneself in that way is very beneficial. And then people say, well, you haven't had kids.
Starting point is 00:37:24
Well, I've had kids in the house, and I also know what it is to get sick because of roommates and all this stuff and working with people and working in a medical center, you're always exposed to things. So, I hear you loud and clear, we can't avoid exposure to infectious vectors, as they're called, delightful in the form of kids. But the reality is, I try and back off when I'm not feeling well. I push when I'm feeling good.
Starting point is 00:37:48
I'm not one to do two a day workouts. And I'm very careful about not exceeding my program. I'm very careful about that. I don't go crazy. I don't do two Pilates classes and then go to the gym. And I'm also not the guy who's complaining about his back or always being sick. And I do not have phenomenal genetics for with respect to fitness. You know, I'm
Starting point is 00:38:08
small jointed or relatively have a medium sized joints. You know, I'm not particularly strong nor do I have particularly strong endurance. You know, I think I'm kind of in the middle. So in terms of medical fitness check, I do blood work every six months. I find that to be that is identified a few things that for me needed taking care of and I pay a lot of attention to Overall feelings of well-being and I chart them frankly on my calendar It's my or my workouts I put the level I put like L1 to 10 typically my workouts are in the 6 to 8 out of 10 intensity I'm not measuring this by any kind of Device and if I get sick I tend to look back and say,
Starting point is 00:38:47
well, what was going on before I got sick? If I'm getting substantially weaker or I'm feeling fatigued, I take stock of what's going on. So I think some people get the impression that I'm hyperanalytic about all things. I would say Atia is much more into measuring things and I love that about him. I'm more of the mindset like if I'm feeling good and I feel like I can move my body well,
Starting point is 00:39:11
not too many aches and pains. In case I get a little something of a little disc bulge or something but and then I take care of it. But in general it's about being able to feel good seated, feel good moving, be able to have that readiness, readiness, readiness. For me, that's the foundation of health. So other things, get a regular eye exam. I do have an appointment in the Ophthalmology Department. Do that air puff test for glaucoma, there are treatments for glaucoma, but you need to know if you have it, a lot of people don't.
Starting point is 00:39:38
Know if they have it, it is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, second only cataract, it's very easy test. You can get from optometrist to the ophthalmologist, get thatact. It's very easy. Test. You can get from optometrist to the ophthalmologist. Get that eye test. Your vision is so precious. Your vision is so precious.
Starting point is 00:39:50
So I can't overstate that enough. It's generally pretty inexpensive as well, especially from the optometrist and the drop's work. Pablo F asks, what do you do with waking up at the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep? I was such a good question. I have three different tools that I use. First of all, long exhale breathing just to try and call myself.
Starting point is 00:40:09
I was trying to relax my face. If I do this right now, it's going to be funny, but relaxing the face tends to relax the jaw and then I'll do a progressive body relaxation. I do use the Revery REV ERI app and they have a specific hypnosis for falling back asleep. Hypnosis is self-directed hypnosis. David Speagle, who's been a guest on the podcast, is voices terrific for hypnosis. You can just think about his voice makes me want to go under.
Starting point is 00:40:32
Typically, with reverie, you practice the falling asleep, falling back asleep. Hypnosis only eight minutes long. You practice that in the daytime and then you can use in the middle of the night if you need to. That does require that you have your phone present. And by the way, if you're going to do that hypnosis, you can select whether or not you're going to do the one where you have to interact and speak or not. I like the
Starting point is 00:40:51
one where you don't interact. Also, if you sleep next to someone, it won't wake them up. Reveries great for this purpose. And you might think hypnosis, that's wacky or that's magic carpet stuff, but it's not. This is, you know, hypnosis, by the way, is one of the few approved medical treatments for various psychological psychiatric conditions. We're not talking about stage hypnosis, people clocking like chickens. We're talking about you learning to self-direct relaxation, which is a skill that you can enhance in hypnosis,
Starting point is 00:41:18
such as with reverie. I think reverie now is a free trial, and it's available on Android and Apple, and it's a nominal cost when you compare to things like supplements or sleeping pills. It's a few dollars each month, maybe $7, $8 or something like that, someone will tell me. But if you think about the cost relative to, you know, some other purchasable, it's relatively low.
Starting point is 00:41:39
The other thing, and this is something that's completely zero cost and I can't encourage it enough, is that you get into a regular practice of non-sleep, deep rest, N-S-D-R or Yoganidra and that you do that during the daytime. There's a 10 minute N-S-D-R that I did, which is available on YouTube. You just put N-S-D-R, cube-room minutes, completely zero cost. It will teach you how to self-direct your own relaxation. And you can also use in the middle of the night if you wake up. Many people fall asleep during NSTRs.
Starting point is 00:42:06
That's fine. Or Yoganidra's, many of which are available on the internet free. Okay. Completely free. Yoganidra is a little bit different than NSTR. It is a category of non-sleep depress that includes intentions and things of that sort, self-directed relaxation. But relaxing is a skill.
Starting point is 00:42:21
Now, there are a few things that you can do to avoid waking up at the middle of the night. One is try and limit the total amount of fluid that you drink in the last couple hours before sleep. Don't go to bed with a super full belly. Some people find that if they take theanine, which is something that is in the sleep stack that I recommend, and by the way, I don't necessarily believe that everyone needs
Starting point is 00:42:40
to take supplements in order to sleep. I think you should get the behavioral stuff, the light, the exercise, not drinking caffeine to late in the day, avoiding alcohol, ideally, completely, but maybe late in the day, especially, et cetera, et cetera. And if you can't get your sleep right that way, then perhaps you start to rely on or enhance your sleep capabilities with supplements,
Starting point is 00:42:59
but there's certainly not a requirement. The sleep supplement, Theanine, which is in the so-called Heurin Lab sleep stack, which includes magnesium 3 and 8, and Apigenin and Theanine. Theanine for some people can really create vivid dreams, and then they wake up from those dreams and they have a whole time falling asleep. In that case, I would just reduce the dosage of or eliminate the Theanine. Some people like to use an acetal, 900 milligram and acetal because they prefer that and that works better or for them than the sleep stack
Starting point is 00:43:29
or some people even take it in addition to the sleep stack. As long as dosages are followed, there's no reason to think that any of this stuff isn't safe, but of course, check with your doctor before adding a room moving anything from your supplement protocol or any protocol for that matter. I say that to protect you, not to protect me. The other thing that you can do if you wake up
Starting point is 00:43:49
in the middle of the night is to not look at the time. Now that's a little bit difficult if you're gonna look at your phone, but this is something that folks at the Stanford sleep clinic taught me that people look at the time when they wake up in the middle of the night generally have a harder time falling back asleep. So to the extent that you can refrain from doing that,
Starting point is 00:44:05
and certainly don't get on your phone and start scrolling social media. Try NSDR, try the Reverevary app, try Yoganadra, try some long exhale breathing, all those protocols, by the way, include long exhale breathing. And if you're taking melatonin before sleep, oftentimes you'll fall asleep very readily
Starting point is 00:44:22
and then wake up. So if you're taking melatonin, you might want to reconsider that. Melatonin does have its place for treatment of jet lag and things of that sort in the acute situation to not taking it too often, but in general, dosages are too high. People take too much of it and too often in my opinion,
Starting point is 00:44:37
but that's just my opinion. And then I would say, if you wake up in the middle of the night and you simply cannot fall back asleep, just remember that you can survive one night with minimal or no sleep. Unfortunately, we've all had to deal with that. If it starts becoming a chronic condition, then you may want to talk to a sleep specialist, but we've done multiple episodes of the Uber and Lab podcast. The master's sleep, perfect your sleep.
Starting point is 00:44:59
We have a sleep newsletter that you should definitely download. It's zero cost. Again, uberandlab.com newsletter. Go to menu newsletter that you should definitely download. It's zero cost. Again, huberinlab.com newsletter. Go to menu newsletter and you can find that. For those of you who subscribed to the premium channel, I'm guessing that you're aware of these various tools. But one thing we know from the sleep lab at Stanford is that when people are excited about their next day, sometimes they wake up and that their sleep actually can be less than normal and they can
Starting point is 00:45:25
function well the next day. In fact, there have been two studies, at least that I'm aware of, two studies. There may be more. Showing that when people are given a quote-unquote poor sleep score, their cognitive performance and physical performance is diminished, even if they slept really long and really well. So they've lied to them in these studies. Conversely, if people haven't slept that much and they receive a great sleep score, they perform really well. So these sleep
Starting point is 00:45:51
scores, while I like them, I look at my eight sleep sleep score or whoops sleep score, some people use or rings and things that sort. You don't want them to drive your perception of how available you are for hard work and cognitive function. So I tend to rely largely on subjective measures. Unless we're talking about things like APOB or cholesterol levels, subjectively guessing what your APOB level is, is not a good approach, right? Or resting heart rate, there are real metrics. But you want to be careful about relying too heavily on biometrics, glean from devices,
Starting point is 00:46:24
even if they're accurate. Don't put too much weight into them, take the average, see how you're doing lately. If your sleep score is dropping each day by 15, 20 points, well then pay attention to that, or your heart rate's going up, or it's going down, you know, averages, averages, averages, you know, and so be a scientist of yourself.
Starting point is 00:46:42
Coach Ruby writes, what's the best protocol for strain training without hypertrophy for women? Great question. When I've lifted heavy weights, I tend to bulk up fast. Okay, I want to embrace more resistance training without the bulk. Great question. So here's the interesting thing about weight training. That's kind of cool. You will never get larger than the so-called pump that you achieve in a single workout. What do I mean by that? Well a lot of people in women in particular
Starting point is 00:47:06
are concerned about getting, quote, unquote, too big, too bulky. And indeed, some women, some men, react very quickly to weight training. They have high fiber density and for whatever reason, it could be hormones, but it probably also has to do with different types of proteins that are expressed in the muscles and even the connective tissues. Some people just grow, quote, unquote,
Starting point is 00:47:31
faster from weight training. But I will tell you this, no one's ever looked at a weight or picked up a weight, done a set, and then hypertrophyed so much that it was permanent, right? The so-called pump, the blood flow that you get into a muscle, gives you a little window into what that muscle might look like if you feed it and rest it properly, so it can recover in hypertrophy. So does that mean that you should avoid the so-called pump, the blood flow into the muscle? No. What do we know from...
Starting point is 00:47:59
Gosh, I guess it would be 40 years of physiological data, and probably hundreds of years of just outside the laboratory data. That very heavy weight in the range of one to three repetitions generally make people stronger but there isn't much hypertrophy. When you get from three to five repetitions, you're still in the mostly strength some hypertrophy range. When you get out towards six repetitions out
Starting point is 00:48:27
to even 30 repetitions, provided the sets are going to failure. You can't perform another repetition in good form. Well, then you're stimulating hypertrophy. Now, there are exceptions to this. There are exceptions. If you do, for instance, a one repetition set with a weight, but that weight allows you to do that set over the course
Starting point is 00:48:47
of 75 seconds. That's a lot of time under tension and you can get hypertrophy. In addition to that, weight training involves an ascensuation of the negative, the eccentric, the lowering portion of each repetition, also will stimulate hypertrophy, but also strength gains. So if you're somebody who wants to strengthen training, and straight training is also important, not just for muscles, but for neural function
Starting point is 00:49:10
in the brain and elsewhere in the body, then you really don't wanna put on any size whatsoever. I would encourage you to explore some of the protocols that Dr. Andy Galpin and I discussed on the exercise series that we did with Dr. Galpin. That would be largely training after a warmup,, of course, in the one-to-three repetition range. And even some training that's done strictly for power moving the weight quickly at loads that are substantially lighter, although for some people, just because they're genetic makeup,
Starting point is 00:49:40
they are going to react with hypertrophy of that kind of training. So I would say if you want to weight train, which is a great idea, and you don't want to put on size, but you want to get stronger training that one to three repetition range. Now that does not necessarily mean one repetition maximums, you know, eging out the absolute last single rep that you can with the most amount of weight. Maybe you back off on your single repetition maximum, you're still just doing one repetition, but of course, if you want that repetition to be of any value in inducing strength, then you should be getting close to your one repetition max. But keep in mind also that if you're doing three repetitions heavy weights, but you're only resting 30 to 120 minutes between sets, well, then you can get a kind of compounding effect where you can
Starting point is 00:50:27
induce hypertrophy. So if you react that well, and by the way, many people do, or there are some, excuse me, many, most people do not, some people do, to lower repetitions, then you may have to increase the weight and lower the repetitions even further, long rest. Just make sure that if you're doing that kind of training, if you're concerned with overall health and not just powerlifting, we're being really, really strong that you're also doing some cardiovascular training, which includes walking plenty and the sorts of cardio that we talked about earlier. Steve says, what are your thoughts on these full body scan MRIs that are becoming quite
Starting point is 00:51:00
popular? Do you think these are beneficial or are they unnecessary? Hmm, well I got one and I paid for it. I didn't get it comped or anything and I must say I learned a lot. Fortunately I learned I don't have any tumors, at least not of the size they could be detected by that MRI. I also learned that I have a disc bulge that explains a lot of times in my life where I do a certain movement. There's one or two movements that I do in the gym. We're running in a certain stride where that thing goes and confirm that. So I've managed to, I'm
Starting point is 00:51:36
very grateful that I only had one white spot on my brain. The white spots are considered naturally occurring typically. Le lesions of the neurons. Everyone has these. You're allowed one per decade of life before they start to consider a potential problem. I think I have that right. It's not a whole lot you can do for those by the way except don't get any more head hits if you're doing a contact sport or construction or something where you can, but some people still have to continue to work. And if that's their work, they have to work.
Starting point is 00:52:07
So yeah, I think it was, it was informative for me. I watched a Netflix movie in there. It was pretty cool. The movie wasn't very good, but it was cool that you can watch a Netflix in there. It's pretty easy to do. They're not cheap. They're a couple thousand dollars minimum. It was reassuring to me to not see any tumors on my liver, tumors on my kidney,
Starting point is 00:52:27
knock on wood, you know, and to see that I didn't have a lot of intracurus or a fat or anything like that. I doubt I'm the healthiest specimen that was ever rolled through there, but it was reassuring to me that I wasn't dealing with a bunch of white spots on the brain, I wasn't dealing with that sort of thing. And, you know, is it necessary? No, no, it's not. Also, some people don't want to know what's going on under the hood. Is it unnecessary? Is what you asked?
Starting point is 00:52:51
That's a tricky one. I mean, it really depends on finances and how curious you are. I will say this, my good friend and former guest on the Hubert Lab podcast, Dr. Eddie Chang, who's a medical doctor and chair of neurosurgery at University of California San Francisco. When I told, asked him about it and I told him I got one, he said, oh yeah, we get people coming in all the time, patients all the time who've gotten these whole body scans for recreational purposes or because they were curious and they will identify issues that need to be resolved with neurosurgery.
Starting point is 00:53:19
Now, that splits my answer in two because that's kind of scary, right? Could there be, could be walking around with tumors on the brain and don't even know it. Yeah, absolutely. For a lot of tumors or benign, a lot of tumors don't impinge on areas of the brain or body that create problems and never create problems and others create problems. And do you want to know? Do you want to get that tumor excised? There are a lot of non-invasive ways to deal with tumors nowadays.
Starting point is 00:53:45
I guess this is the question of whether or not you want to know. And when I say want to know, I mean, obviously everyone would love to know that they have a clean bill of health under the hood, but are you prepared for what might happen psychologically and medically and what you would have to do in order to remove an issue that maybe not an issue, right? It's possible that you have a growth or a mass that's been on, but then you have the anxiety of the period in between. So it's tricky. Some tissues like prostate tissues or different tissues in the female reproductive track can be enlarged but not be problematic.
Starting point is 00:54:21
But then people might want to make changes to ensure that the enlargement doesn't continue. I'm a big believer in data. I like data. So while I'm not big on track in my sleep every night, I do track it at night, but I don't necessarily put too much weight on any one individual night's sleep score. And by the way, if you get a really lousy, lousy sleep score chance, are you know you've slept poorly? If you guys have great sleep score chances are you know you slept well. So stuff in between that kind of gets people interested. I don't know. I think for me I was happy to get the bill of health I did and had I discovered something that needed dealing with. I guess I'd be grateful that I went in for it.
Starting point is 00:55:00
So that's my answer. But again, they're expensive. I hope the cost comes down. I hope insurance will cover these eventually. Orcaavista. What a great name. Orcalavista. Awesome. Ask. Would you as a dog lover considering doing an episode on dog wellness and communication? Yes. Yes. Absolutely. I love dogs. I love dogs so much. It's ridiculous. I just do. I just, I like being around them. I like thinking about them. I like hanging out with them. And they're family members, right? Costello is a family member. And I'm eagerly anticipating getting another dog, probably when we get back from tour in Australia, from Australia. I'm not gonna bring back an Australian shepherd. They have way too much energy for me.
Starting point is 00:55:48
I like the mellow dogs. I like economy of effort in a dog, which is why a bulldog or a mastiff is probably a good one for me. Yes, yes, and yes, pet health is key. Relationships with pets are key. Don't get a dog that you can't take great care of and bulldogs are a ton of work and they're very expensive. Plan on spending at least, I'm not kidding, $20,000 a year of medical bills on a dog that you can't take great care of. And bulldogs are a ton of work and they're very expensive.
Starting point is 00:56:05
Plan on spending at least, I'm not kidding, $20,000 a year medical bills on a dog to keep, bulldog to keep them healthy. Adopt, if you can. A lot of dogs out there need, need be adopted. Hidia M says, I need advice, I'm 32, I'm working out for two, three years, but my left arm is weaker than my right.
Starting point is 00:56:23
How do I balance muscle strength between size? Different weights or strategies? Great question. Well, I guess you're assuming that's a lot weaker. I mean, I am a big believer in doing unilateral movements. I can't remember the last time I did a barbell curl or a, you know, the thing they call the easy bar tricep extension. I almost always do unilateral stuff, dumbbell curls.
Starting point is 00:56:45
I think the real key if you want a weaker arm or limb to get stronger is that mind muscle connection. You know, it means presumably, unless there's some sort of underlying neurologic thing and I don't want to scare you, it's always possible. But it seems unlikely based on the way you word the question, is that you want to make sure you're gripping the handle the way it really tightly. By the way, that will increase your strength and performance on the set to grip tightly. There's neural reasons for that.
Starting point is 00:57:09
And that you're really working hard to contract the muscle and also use weights that you can control. Remember when you lift weights for sake of getting stronger, it's not about lifting weights. You're actually using the weight as a tool to stimulate strength and hypertrophy increases. So it's a tool and you don't walk around with the weight number on your body You walk around with the muscle development that you achieved and the strength that you achieved
Starting point is 00:57:32
With a particular weight and no one cares what that weight is so if you're you know if you can't carry two bags of groceries up the stairs Doesn't matter if you were able to you know carry 400 pound dumbbells Through the gym, right? I mean, that's why I think the readiness thing is key. I think we think so much about the gym as the endpoint, but the gym is a place for training for the rest of life, in my opinion. It also happens to be fun for me, but if your left arm is weaker, I would emphasize,
Starting point is 00:58:02
well, you could perhaps do more sets. Certainly, I would do, you could do all your left arm sets first than your right arm sets. If it's really substantially different, you may actually want to stop training the right side as intensely for a period of time to get that left arm up there. Things like that, but I like unilateral work. I don't do a lot of unilateral work for my legs. I think I do leg curls. No, that's both like same time. I definitely try and pull
Starting point is 00:58:29
with both like same time, leg extension same time, haxquat same time, glute hammer same time. Okay, yeah. Just keep training it, but don't over train it. If it's really weak because you're giving it 25 sets, make sure you're allowing time for it to recover. And by the way, I don't know how, I don't recall, because the question's gone now, how old are you are, but give your body time. Give your body time. I started training when I was 16.
Starting point is 00:58:53
Give your body time. It takes time to train correctly. And it takes time to develop a strong mind muscle connection. And don't rush, don't run out there and start using, you know, don't get cavalier with pharmaceuticals or anything else, just take your time, enjoy your training. The best advice I ever got about training with somebody very accomplished and he said,
Starting point is 00:59:13
and I really internalized this, like, learn to, and you may delete the learn to, learn to enjoy training really hard, or just love training hard, I love training hard. I love it. I love it. I love it. So just learn that. Like lean into that process and enjoy it. And if you, and if there's certain parts that are challenging, remember you're increasing the size of that medial, enter your mid-singulate cortex. Last question, really? I was, what's going on? We just keep going. Maybe I'll do like a 24 hour marathon of this and then we also do it as a
Starting point is 00:59:43
as a study and sleep deprivation. Does anyone want to vote for that? I've done that before. I used to work 36 hours stretches when I was in graduate school, no joke. We would do these physiology experiments. My producer here sitting here going like, don't do it.
Starting point is 00:59:56
But it's probably by the end of those experiments, we'd be wearing tin foil on our heads, and we were doing these experiments. But we built a lot of resilience. We survived on in and out burgers, and I was like, don't eat the bun, because the car Was gonna make you sleepy and then we'd we'd argue about it and we did you know
Starting point is 01:00:08
I would start to hallucinate somewhere around the 30-hour mark my friend Kalenza. He's now a professor back at University of Maryland so he can he can vouch for that story, but gosh that was fun. I don't miss it I was in my 20s 30s. Yeah, no 20s late 20s But if people think it we maybe we do a fundraiser like rate raise extra money for research That was in my 20s, 30s. Yeah, I know 20s, late 20s. But if people think that maybe we do a fundraiser, like raise extra money for research, and I'll do 24 hours of just answering questions around the clock and just see how, you know, see at what point I just completely call.
Starting point is 01:00:36
And then I can also teach you guys how to do a proper all-nighter because there are tools. And one of the main tools is don't trust your thinking between the hours of 2.30 AM and 4 AM. so maybe during that time we just all meditate together. All right, last question until we do the 24 hour Hebrew and lab AMA marathon. Do you have plans to produce more content or protocol specifically for children's development and health? Yes, we're going to do a children's or child development series but that also extends
Starting point is 01:01:02
into adolescence and young adulthood. I'm also going to be doing episodes on that. I have some amazing guests for them and do some solos as well. Are there any current resources you recommend for this topic? Yeah, I like Alan Schor's book. It's a little detailed, little technical, SCHOR. Alan Schor, I think it's how you spell it. Let me check at UCLA.
Starting point is 01:01:22
A little technical Alan Schor. Yeah, ALAN, separate word, S-C-H-O-R-E. His psychologist in research, it really talks about regulation of the, he talks about right brain left brain in a way that actually is accurate. There are a few people who talk about right brain left brain accurately. He does and talks about attachment and emotional regulation and it's mainly focused on early childhood development. There's some beautiful, you know, there's some beautiful stuff out
Starting point is 01:01:50
there that's that's been, comes from the psychology literature and neuroscience literature on this, but I'm also going to get my friend Dr. Linda Wilberick on the podcast. She's a professor at Berkeley Studies adolescent development. There's just so many great folks out there that we want to bring onto the podcast. And we will organize that into some protocols and things of that sort. A lot of work to do for us to get it all succinct. I realize sometimes podcasts are long.
Starting point is 01:02:15
Sometimes people ask, I often get asked, what are the plans for 2024? What are you gonna do? Keep improving the content. We actually have some shorter form content coming out. I don't wanna give away what that is. There's some 30 minute episodes that capture the essence of the most important protocols in science.
Starting point is 01:02:33
And the goal for 2024 and forward is just keep improving the content and try and make it as succinct and digestible for you as possible, but also as thorough. If I go real short form, then important details would get lost, but child development is extremely important. And remember, we're always in development development doesn't stop when we hit 25. Development is an arc from birth until death, which hopefully will be a long time
Starting point is 01:02:57
from now for all of you. And there's just a ton to explore there, a lot of science psychology protocols. We're gonna get into all of it. So, I was told that's the last question. I confess. I'm a little bit sad about that. I could just keep going But maybe we'll do this again at some point and I think we should do that 24 hour marathon as a fundraiser I don't know what you think, but I would do it anyway. That's the truth. I'd be here anyway I want to thank everyone for tuning in. Thanks ever so much for your support of the labs I mentioned earlier. If you know somebody who you think might be interested in the premium channel, let them
Starting point is 01:03:33
know that they can watch the early parts of those premium channel episodes on YouTube and listen to them on Apple and Spotify without having to log on for, you know, not having to pay, not everyone has the resources. For those of you that devoted resources to the podcast, the premium channel, just know that it helps support the regular podcast, which of course is available cost-free to everybody. It really subsidizes that, and it's also subsidizing this research that's taking place in these laboratories, and we're going to expand the research. We got that $3-1 match for 2024. So, I really enjoyed today.
Starting point is 01:04:05
That's the truth. I love your questions. I could do this all day every day. We're going to record an episode today and tomorrow. And I'm basically just going to keep talking until they tell me it's time to stop. So when someone in the corner goes like, like, it is, then I'll stop.
Starting point is 01:04:18
If you ever been to one of our live events, like they're supposed to end, and not there, there you go. They're telling me to stop. It's time's up. Thank you you everybody. I hope you had a great holiday. I hope everyone has a very happy New Year's. If you're like me and you're gonna be sleep by 10, 30 on New Year's,
Starting point is 01:04:33
enjoy the good night's sleep and enjoy New Year's day. I'm a big New Year's day guy. Get out on New Year's day and enjoy something. And just remember, whether or not you're doing behavioral protocols or you're super into the supplements of the red lights, the most important thing is those pillars of sleep, nutrition, exercise, stress management, sunlight. I guess we're getting up to six and social connection.
Starting point is 01:04:54
So it's a lot to try and do all that all the time. Don't pressure yourself. Meanwhile, thank you for everything that you do for us. And last but certainly not least, thank you for your interesting science.
