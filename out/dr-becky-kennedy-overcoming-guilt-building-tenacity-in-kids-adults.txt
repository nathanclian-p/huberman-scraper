Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Dr. Becky Kennedy. Dr. Becky Kennedy is a clinical psychologist
Starting point is 00:00:20
and one of the world's foremost experts in parent-child relationships. Now, you may or may not have children. If you do, today's episode is absolutely for you. If you don't, well, you were once a child. Perhaps you're even still a child. Today's episode also will have valuable knowledge and tools that you can apply to your life.
Starting point is 00:00:38
Today, Dr. Becky Kennedy teaches us an immense number of extremely valuable tools for the workplace, for romantic relationships, for romantic relationships, for family relationships of all types, not just parent-child relationships, and of course also for parent-child relationships. We discuss themes that have not been discussed previously on the Huberman Lab podcast, topics such as guilt,
Starting point is 00:00:58
which Dr. Becky Kennedy offers a completely unique perspective on, one that I've never heard before, and that frankly, I don't think anyone has heard before. In fact, she distinguishes between what most people think is guilt and an entirely different set of emotions, and offers you very useful practical tools
Starting point is 00:01:14
for when you experience guilt and how to work with guilt. We also extensively discuss frustration, or what she calls frustration tolerance. Frustration tolerance is an extremely important theme for everybody to understand and apply in their lives because frustration tolerance, as Dr. Becky Kennedy so aptly points out, is central to the learning process of anything at every age.
Starting point is 00:01:35
If you can understand this concept and you apply some of the very simple rules and tools that Dr. Kennedy explains during the podcast, I assure you, you can learn many more things much more quickly and with much greater satisfaction, if not during the podcast, I assure you, you can learn many more things much more quickly and with much greater satisfaction, if not during the process, certainly at the end, when you master that learning. And those are just a few of the themes
Starting point is 00:01:52
that we discussed during today's episode. Again, whether or not you have children, I assure you that today's episode is going to be immensely beneficial for all of your relationships. You will notice during today's episode that our studio backdrop is different. You will notice during today's episode that our studio backdrop is different. You will notice that for once,
Starting point is 00:02:08
I was not wearing this particular style of shirt. The reason for that is that this episode was recorded during the LA fires, what was initially called the Palisades fire and then spread to multiple fires throughout LA County. So we were not able to access our normal studio. So I want to express extreme gratitude to Rich Roll, our good friend in the podcasting space
Starting point is 00:02:28
who allowed us to use his podcast studio, which is where I'm seated now and where I held the discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy. First off, our entire team, our homes and our studio are fine, I can assure you of that. But most importantly, our thoughts and our prayers go out to the people who have lost their homes, lost pets, and sadly there have been fatalities during the LA fires.
Starting point is 00:02:49
So our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, and we hope everyone remains safe. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme,
Starting point is 00:03:08
today's episode does include sponsors. And now for my discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy. Dr. Becky Kennedy, welcome back. I'm so happy to be here. Grateful to Rich Roll for lending us his studio under the duress of fires in Los Angeles, I'm praying that his home is okay. It's unclear at this moment, but in any event, let's talk about emotions, both theory and practice.
Starting point is 00:03:36
And if we can place it in the context of parenting, that would be great, but I'm certain that this has a broader theme that pertains to everybody. So I love the theory of emotions or how we would theoretically respond to something, but then there's the reality. So as a parent, let's say you have a stance in your home and in your family that it's okay to be sad.
Starting point is 00:04:00
Like sadness is normal, it happens, it passes, et cetera. But let's say you're feeling particularly sad about something. Do you express that and show that in front of your kids? Because I've also heard that young kids in particular, younger than eight or nine, perhaps shouldn't be aware that their parents are experiencing, say, extreme sadness because it can be scary to them or they might feel like their world is destabilizing. And then we also hear a lot about kids feeling like they had to parent the parents and then this whole thing becomes pretty complicated.
Starting point is 00:04:34
So while there's no perfect world where one knows what to do every single time, how do you look at this business of modeling emotions and also encouraging kids to be able to experience and express their emotions? Yeah, and I think everything I'm about to share applies, you know, in the workplace, right? Like can a boss be, you know, really upset in front of the person they manage, management, right? So it's all the same stuff.
Starting point is 00:04:59
So I guess zooming out as a start, emotions are normal, emotions are normal. Emotions are unstoppable. You can't not feel sad just because you have your five-year-old in the room, right? And I think the other thing that kind of forms my perspective is it's really hard to not show someone that you're sad. You might think you're doing that well, but kids are extra perceptive.
Starting point is 00:05:27
They are actually built to be more perceptive than we are because their survival depends on adults, so they have to always notice, is my adult around? Is my adult okay? So they really attune to what's going on for us, right? And so I think the kind of question is less, do I show my emotions to my kid or not? And it's more, okay, if I'm sad, my kid is going to notice. What do I do then? And as a principal, one of the things I think about often is information
Starting point is 00:06:00
doesn't scare kids as much as the absence of information scares kids. So let's say there's something really awful. I don't know. As a parent, you're a family member. Someone died of cancer. I don't know. There's something really horrible that you just found out, right? There's wildfires right now.
Starting point is 00:06:19
Let's say you evacuated and you found out your house burned down. You're sad. Your child is going to notice that and you want your child to notice that. You don't want your kid to be a teenager and adult who goes around the world, unable to pick up on emotional cues from other people. That's not adaptive.
Starting point is 00:06:42
And so the patterns we set with our kids when they're young inform their view of the world when they're older. And so here I am, let's say it's the situation of somebody dying and I'm upset. First of all, as a parent, tell yourself, it's not my kid seeing me sad that's going to destabilize them. It's seeing me sad and me making up a bogus story or denying it because then my kid goes, pretty sure my mom was upset. Oh, she's not? Oh, she's pretending like nothing happened? Oh, she looks sad but she's saying she's not sad. That is really upsetting. It would be like hearing your boss say, oh yeah, 20% layoffs. What are we doing? I don't know.
Starting point is 00:07:27
Oh hi, everything's great. How are you? Like, what is happening? Scary. What you'd want is your boss say you just heard something. You were right to hear that. We are about to go through a really tough time. I'm stressed about it. That's why I yelled. You might be stressed. Here's what I know. This is going to be hard and we're going to get through it together." Now, all of a sudden, that emotional experience has a container. It has a story. Humans need stories. We like stories.
Starting point is 00:07:56
And so often we think it's the emotions that dysregulate a kid. It's the lack of a story to explain it. So let's say this really did happen. People always say to me, okay, but Dr. Becky, like my kid is four, I'm gonna say that their aunt died. They don't even know cancer, right? We don't have a better alternative. I can't even tell you how many parents I've seen whose kids have all of these issues
Starting point is 00:08:19
because of the made up stories. I just said she went to sleep for a while. Six months later, my kid has a lot of trouble sleeping through the night. Yeah, they haven't seen their aunt who went to sleep one time. It creates a huge issue no matter what bogus story you make up. Kids can handle the truth, and they can handle the truth when it's told to them from a loving, trusted adult. It's kind of like me and you. Someone can tell us a hard truth, but it's from someone you feel safe with and that you feel like also believes in you and says that honestly,
Starting point is 00:08:49
it might be hard, but it doesn't feel awful. So it's about saying to your kid, you saw me crying. One of my favorite kind of sentences to say to kids around this, because I think it really builds their confidence, is just, you were right to notice that. I was crying, and I'm feeling sad, and look, you saw that, I'm gonna tell you why. Making this up, Aunt Sally died. Do you know what dying means? Dying is when someone's body stops working.
Starting point is 00:09:22
Then I'd pause, all right, so it'd just be a monologue, I'll see how my kid responds. I might add, I'm not dying. Kids actually really need to hear that in hard times. I'm not dying. No one else is dying. I'm safe. And you know what? I'm sad. And I'm still your strong mom who can take care of you." That sets the stage for such resilience and is kind of the opposite of everything's fine, my kid keeps seeing me crying, they keep hearing words, they're not used to hearing, die, cancer, Aunt Sally, funeral, whatever it is, that situation is what makes kids feel
Starting point is 00:10:02
really, really uncomfortable and unsafe. So it's the absence of information that causes the harm. And it's the lack of coherence between what they're observing and feeling and kind of this like open loop. If I kind of place it in neuroscience-y terms, I feel like the brain does think in the terms of stories. Stories have a beginning, middle, and an end, and they kind of want to know where they are in that story. That's exactly right.
Starting point is 00:10:32
And the terms I would use to match your terms are coherent narrative. What is therapy? Why does therapy help people? It's interesting. Therapy doesn't change what happened to you. Therapy doesn't change your past. Therapy does not take away the pain. But the pain was never the thing that really got in our way. It was the pain plus a lack of a coherent narrative and support. And so early on,
Starting point is 00:10:56
when kids have painful experiences from witnessing you or something else, giving them a coherent narrative is what they need. And without that, the way I think about it is, they have what I call unformulated experience. It's just affect and experience that kind of free floats in their body, unformulated, that tends to later show up as triggers, right? And kind of other things in adulthood. And so, yeah, that's what we want to try to avoid when we can.

For more information, see the episode description. Today's episode is also brought to us by Our Place. Our Place makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware. Surprisingly, toxic compounds such as the PFAS or forever chemicals are still found in 80% of nonstick pans, as well as utensils, appliances, and countless other
Starting point is 00:13:10
kitchen products. As I've discussed on this podcast, these PFAS or forever chemicals like Teflon have been linked to major health issues such as endocrine disruption, gut microbiome disruption, fertility issues, and many other health problems. So it's really important to avoid them. This is why I've recently fallen in love with our place products, especially one of their cooking pans, the titanium always pan pro our place products are made with the highest quality materials and are all PFAS and toxin free. They're beautifully designed and function extremely well. As I mentioned, I love the titanium always pan pro from our Place. I cook eggs in it most mornings and the Titanium pan is designed in a way that allows the eggs
Starting point is 00:13:49
to cook perfectly without sticking to the pan. I also cook burgers on it and it really puts a nice sear on the burger without the meat sticking to the pan. It's extremely easy to clean and like all Our Place products, it's nice to look at when sitting out on the counter or stove. For a limited time, Our Place is offering an exclusive 20% discount on their innovative titanium Always Pan Pro, designed to last a lifetime and completely toxin-free.

Starting point is 00:14:26
I can't help but put this neuroscience lens on this because I find it so interesting that what you're basically saying, if I understand correctly, is that until we can place things into a story, which is really a sense of beginning, middle and end, a sense of time, it just reverberates in us. I mean, I think, I can't help myself, you know,
Starting point is 00:14:47
I don't want to give the impression we've got fires burning all around us in terms of this building, but with some distance between us and the fires, that's actually true. And I think one of the things that's so destabilizing for kids and adults in this kind of circumstance is that we don't know how this is going to work out. We just don't.
Starting point is 00:15:03
And of course, none of us have a crystal ball. We can't peer into the future. But it's the not knowing that, really extends our brain resources. And I can imagine that for a kid, seeing their parent upset and then hearing, well, no, I'm okay, I'm okay, would create this kind of open loop
Starting point is 00:15:20
where then the kid has to worry about it. Like, when will this come to an end? One question about expressing sadness open loop where then the kid has to worry about it. Like when will this come to an end? One question about expressing sadness in front of a child. And if let's say somebody expresses why they're sad, is it okay to accept consolation from the kid? Because we hear so much that, you know, we shouldn't have to parent as children, we shouldn't have to parent our parents.
Starting point is 00:15:44
And this is a big theme, especially on social media nowadays. Like, were you the parent to your parent? Were you the one that took out the trash when someone else should have done it, and therefore you took on more responsibilities? I don't want kids to think they shouldn't take out the trash, but you know what I mean? But if you're consoling a parent about a lost job,
Starting point is 00:16:01
if you're the kid that is sort of the go- of the go between the parents as sort of acting as therapist, we hear about this a lot, a lot. And I think a lot of people peer into their past and say, yeah, I grew up way too fast. So on the other hand, I think we would all agree that being a empathic person, teaching our kids that if somebody's crying, you wanna to walk over to that person, perhaps, and just say, you know,
Starting point is 00:16:27
do you want me to sit with you or maybe do nothing at all? Maybe offer a solution, maybe not. But at least, you know, provide some sort of support. That seems healthy. But the basic question is, should parents accept consolation from children when the parent is sad or experiencing some other negative emotion? I think this is a great question.
Starting point is 00:16:47
There's a couple of things that are coming to mind. So first of all, all of this is a matter of extent and patterning. Yes, we do not want our kids to feel like it is their job to take care of our emotions. It's not a good situation. And I think the difference here actually comes down to what the true definition of empathy is. To me, empathy is noticing someone's feelings and caring about them. It's not taking care of them.
Starting point is 00:17:16
That's a big difference. So let's say I'm crying and my kid comes over and this whole situation, maybe somebody died and they're like, oh my goodness, mom, can I give you a hug? And do you want me to get you a cup of water? Okay, I just want parents to know, you don't have to say, no, no, I do not want you to be a parentified child. Like, be like, that is so, that is so kind.
Starting point is 00:17:37
Yes, that would feel great. Okay, that's totally fine. I think the line is, and every parent just knows this for themself, where it might get to, oh, you know what? I love that you're noticing I'm sad, and I love that you care about that, and I also want to let you know those are my feelings, not yours, and I am really able to take care
Starting point is 00:17:59
of them myself, with whoever it is, a friend, and you're still really allowed to be a kid who can go play, who can go have fun, who can even not listen to me once in a while when I say it's bath time. That's actually your job. So let's go do our jobs well. And to me, that comes down to what empathy is, the delineation of like, what is a parent's job and what is a kid's job. But also I think all of this can get misrepresented in social media.
Starting point is 00:18:29
And I don't want parents to think that they always have to chastise their kid for acting in a caring way. Yeah, I feel like kids are, as you said before, kids are so perceptive about what their parents are experiencing. And they'll create or move towards all sorts of emotional gymnastics in order to work with that. Years ago, I saw, I think it was a YouTube video with Jim Carrey, who basically revealed that he became funny as a way to make his sick mom laugh,
Starting point is 00:18:58
that he grew up with a very sick mom, which is chronically ill. And so he would like throw himself down the stairs and try and make her laugh or do, you know, and he was an incredible world-class physical comic, among other aspects of comedy. But that his whole career was born out of this childhood tendency to notice
Starting point is 00:19:16
that his mom was really hurting and try and basically make her laugh, make her feel something good. And it, you know, now I'm thinking about this because it's just incredible the way that kids can pick up on something and then try and find a solution to it. Yeah.
Starting point is 00:19:32
I could imagine that for kids who have a sick parent, could be a mental challenges or physical challenges that they've got to notice. Yes. And in the case of Jim Carrey, one could argue whether or not it was adaptive or not adaptive, he had this, you know, meteoric career, but eventually just left it,
Starting point is 00:19:48
decided that wasn't what he wanted to do. Yeah. But leaving that extreme example aside, let's say a parent is sick with the flu or is grieving the loss of, God forbid, a spouse or something really major. Yeah. At what point does the parent need to say,
Starting point is 00:20:09
listen, I'm really hurting, this is bad, and I can handle it. When that might not actually be true. So the question is, you know, how much information to give kids? Yeah. Because you don't wanna lie to them. On the other hand, you don't want them to feel the burden
Starting point is 00:20:28
of needing to worry about a circumstance. And I'm framing this in the context of sick parent, but I'm also raising this thing of financial worries. Yeah. I have a close friend who told me that growing up, their parent was like constantly dealing with, you know, moving from one job to the next. It was like this issue of whether or not we're going to have enough resources to get through
Starting point is 00:20:52
the next year was a constant question. And this person is now in their mid thirties and you can tell it still haunts them. And it's completely shaped their relationship to work and finances. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think we can think about this compared to, what would I want from my boss? I have a boss who's, I don't know,
Starting point is 00:21:10
going through a really hard time or having a really hard time at home. And I kind of notice it. I'd probably want my boss to level with me and say, kind of again, you're right to notice, I'm going through a hard time. But at what point would it feel like, ooh, am I safe in this organization?
Starting point is 00:21:27
Right? I think we probably all have a point there. And I think it's the same thing with kids. Kids really do need to feel like they have sturdy parents. Again, I always go back to pilots because I think airplane examples are so powerful because there's very few times in adulthood that we actually feel like our safety is truly dependent on another adult, like 100%. When you're a passenger in an airplane,
Starting point is 00:21:51
you are 100% dependent, so it's kind of the closest dynamic. And you can imagine what it would be like if the pilot was saying, going through a really hard time, who wants to come in and give me, you know, I don't know, you know, tell me a nice story. You'd be like, oh, my goodness, like, Kat, you know, I don't know, you know, tell me a nice story. You're like, oh my goodness, like, Kat, you're going through a hard time, but this is really
Starting point is 00:22:09
not feeling great, right? And what that means, and which is, you know, kind of even a larger point, is if you're a pilot, you need to make sure you're really doing a lot of self-care, more than the average person because of this outsized responsibility you have. This is what I think about parenting. And it's why, you know, the bigger theme here is this is what gets me out of bed, you know, every morning so motivated is not just to help parents understand tantrums or emotions or, you know, the latest struggle in their house, although I actually love that.
Starting point is 00:22:40
It's just like, hold on, like we've been really been really sold an awful story about what it really means to be a parent and how parenting really, first and foremost, is a journey of self-care. How can I be the sturdiest person possible? Who do I need in my life when things go poorly so I don't lean on my young children and give them a responsibility that is not theirs. You know, I was just saying to someone the other day that when you have kids, all of the unhealed parts of your childhood
Starting point is 00:23:14
come right before your eyes. They are just triggered over and over and over with your own children. Like, you know, oh, my kid's whining, I can't deal with that. Oh, well, whining is probably triggering because it's kind of representative of helplessness. What was it like in my family if I kind of felt helpless? Was that allowed?
Starting point is 00:23:31
Did I grow up in a, you know, if you don't stop crying, I'll give you something to cry about family. Okay, if I don't resolve that, I'm going to act that all out on my children and pass that along. So all of kind of these situations where parents are feeling all these different emotions from a trigger, from something in their life, I think it goes to what I always tell parents, you know, you have a first and foremost job
Starting point is 00:23:58
of self-care and taking care of yourself. That doesn't mean traveling to Europe for the year and leaving your kids alone. It means what is going on inside you? What skills do you need? What networks of support do you need? What do you have around you to help you on the hardest journey of your life
Starting point is 00:24:14
and the most rewarding one of being a parent so that you don't have to say to your kids, you know, oh, you know, can you kind of take care of me? Paul Conti, who came on this podcast to do a series about mental health, you know, oh, you know, can you kind of take care of me? Paul Conti, who came on this podcast to do a series about mental health, not just mental challenges, but also mental health, which is an interesting concept in its own right, has been quoted as saying that, you know,
Starting point is 00:24:38
that if you were to list out the hundred most important things for romantic relationships, it would be self-care and communication repeated 50 times. And I'm thinking about that now because sounds like a pretty good model for pretty much every relationship. Yes. Self-care, communication.
Starting point is 00:24:56
And I must say, the first time I heard him say that, it wasn't on my podcast, it was on a different podcast, sort of surprised. I thought, self-care first? But the way you're framing it seems to me that if self-care comes first, or at least very high on the list of what parents should do, it frees up the kids to live and experience life with a lot more ease, a lot more peace,
Starting point is 00:25:20
and to basically unburden them of about 50,000 jobs. That's exactly right. And I think self-care has gotten, you know, misrepresented. It doesn't mean getting a manicure every week. It could, if that does it for you. But when I think about self-care and I really think about the work we do with parents at Good Inside, we always say Good Inside, and like our app, it's not parenting.
Starting point is 00:25:43
It's for parents. It's for the journey of what it means to be a parent. It's for your own stuff. It's for your triggers. It's for finally learning how to set boundaries. It's about finally learning that it's okay to get your needs met, even when they inconvenience others.
Starting point is 00:25:57
It's learning that your relationships are strong enough that they can get through hard moments where people are upset with you, right? It's about finally saying to, if you need to, your mother-in-law, we can't have any visitors on Saturday. And the reason I'm finally able to do that is because I understand my self-value
Starting point is 00:26:15
and all this stuff that has nothing to do with the fact that your kid isn't sleeping at night. But that is the foundation for intervening in the way you're proud of when your kid is waking you up at two in the morning. Right, so that is the foundation for intervening in the way you're proud of when your kid is waking you up at two in the morning? So that is the self-care. It's really like a, not just self-care, it's self-establishment.
Starting point is 00:26:32
It's self-growth really. I don't know the psychology literature or clinical literature around this, but I'm thinking about speed of emotional shifts. In my own experience of life, I've known moody people and I've known not as moody people. I define moody as people whose moods fluctuate quickly and sometimes spontaneously. But this idea that some people are like steady as a rock is a great concept.
Starting point is 00:27:03
But we also know that we need to feel our emotions, express them to some extent. And yet there are people where if we were to plot this, it would look like a high frequency wave where some people are really upset, then they're feeling better again. They're upset, then they're feeling better again. I'm not talking about extreme pathology here.
Starting point is 00:27:18
I'm talking about, you know, someone cuts them off in traffic and they're pissed, but then they're fine. They're very, very happy about something they see. So it doesn't always have to be negative, but then they're fine. They're very, very happy about something they see. So it doesn't always have to be negative, but then they're kind of like flat affect, and then they're into something negative. I think that experience of emotions
Starting point is 00:27:34
is so far and away different from the experience of emotions emitted from somebody who, you can kind of see the emotion coming. It's like a slow swell. It's like a expansion and then a contraction again, that you have time. And I feel like I keep coming back
Starting point is 00:27:51
to this theme of time perception. Anytime we have time or we hear about like in all the Buddhist traditions, like space, like you're trying to create mental space and this gap between stimulus and response, it all sounds great, but with some people, you have to really be on your toes, or perhaps you disengage.
Starting point is 00:28:09
And so I've never heard a satisfying answer to this, probably because I've never asked it out loud. If you're a kid or if you're a parent and somebody is experiencing something, let's say they're really angry or really happy, you can imagine riding that wave in with them. You could also imagine sitting back from it. And some of this is probably what we'd call temperament.
Starting point is 00:28:31
But maybe you could talk about this a little bit in the context of having one or both parents that's kind of like a high frequency shifts between emotions versus kind of a slow expansion and then settling of emotions. Because I feel like those are two completely different experiences of life. Yeah.
Starting point is 00:28:49
I mean, I think you're speaking to how differently we feel emotions. I mean, you know, I think about one of my kids who I call a deeply feeling kid, right? So my image is always, she's just more porous to the world. And so if you think about someone who's more porous, that their pores are literally wider, a lot more is going to come in. And guess what? A lot more is going to come out, right? And she's a kid who, by the way, you're in a certain area in New York
Starting point is 00:29:17
City. She's like, I can't be here. The smell. For me, I'm wired differently. I was like, I literally don't smell anything different. Now, does that mean she's wrong? No. I actually bet knowing her she smells things, and then she lets me know how awful it is, and she can't stand on that corner. And for me, in that moment at least, because we're probably all volatile in different ways,
Starting point is 00:29:37
I look steady as a rock. Right? I have another kid who, yeah, is pretty steady, until he feels like his authority and power is threatened and then he better watch out, you know? And so in one moment, someone might see him as, oh, wow, that kid's really volatile, but in probably 90% of other moments,
Starting point is 00:29:58
he's kind of cool as a cucumber. So I also think it's important to categorize kids not as like always one way or another, but we all feel emotions differently. None of them is wrong or right. To me, the goal is to not be locked into any one thing. That, to me, rigidity is always the enemy. That's what holds us back in adulthood, if we're always one way.
Starting point is 00:30:23
I can never handle someone cutting me off in traffic because the emotion takes me over and I have road rage. Yeah, that's not good. That's a very rigid, limited way of living life. But it's probably also limiting to say, I've never really gotten riled up about anything. Forget road rage, but it's kind of amazing to get riled up once in a while
Starting point is 00:30:40
and to feel really passionately about something and to feel something enough that you wanna go do something about it, right? So there's no morality on it. I think what's tricky, I can even say, as a parent of three kids, is each of my kids, I always kind of imagine this, if I have all these different parts of me,
Starting point is 00:30:56
they each need a different part of me to kind of lead. Like, they almost need different lead parents, right? So my kid who is my deeply feeling kid, I know what's so important is that I believe her experience and I better be ready with certain boundaries because she feels things so intensely, especially when she was younger. I have to step in more often. There's more difficult behavior, right? My kid who's really, really steady, I try to sometimes, even though it's convenient because he's so easy, there's definitely a lot going on in there.
Starting point is 00:31:29
Sometimes I wonder, does he almost feel like all the emotional space is taken up by his siblings and the only thing left for him is kind of steady as a rock? That can lead to a rigidity later in life. I think these are like moving systems. So much of how we experience emotions growing up is also dictated by the system and kind of the roles our siblings play. And so I don't know if that kind of gives you enough of an answer. But I think that's very, that's informative. Yeah, I think the thing I'd really want parents to know is I think we place a lot of morality on it. And if we're honest with ourselves, we're
Starting point is 00:32:04
probably just comparing our kid to how we do things So if you're someone who's pretty steady, you're like my kid is crazy. They're dramatic, right? If you're someone who's a little more out there You're not as bothered by that kid and then you have another kid you're like that kids kind of boring, right? Because they're so flat and so I mean, I think this is true in couples too whenever we're fighting We're probably just saying why can't you be more like me when we're triggered by, we're probably just saying, why can't you be more like me? When we're triggered by our kid, we're like, why can't you be more like me? Right, that's probably what we're always saying
Starting point is 00:32:28
to each other, going back to communication. But if you take a little different perspective of, hold on a second, there's no wrong or right way to feel emotions. Some behaviors are not allowed, but all the emotions have information. And what might my kid need right now instead of, oh my goodness, is my kid messed up,
Starting point is 00:32:47
or why is my kid not just a little bit more like me? How useful is it to talk to kids about emotions when they're not happening? I mean, to me, this is something, like, I always just say, I always phrase it as emotion talk, right? Just... knowing that emotions live within you, knowing that there's names for them, that they're normal, that they make sense, to me it's like the ultimate leg up in life. It gives your kids such resilience because we can't beat our emotions. I feel
Starting point is 00:33:22
like we've been trying that for generations. Like If I just only didn't feel so angry or so jealous or so sad, our emotions are so primal in our body. And I really do believe emotions, they're information. That's what they are. Why would we ever want to not get the information our body is giving us? And sometimes it's almost dramatic what happens in an amazing way.
Starting point is 00:33:45
Like, so many people, I think about so many times I have people in a room for therapy, they start crying, I'm so sorry. You're feeling something so intensely that your body is producing water from your eyes to get your attention. Like, that's, that must be really important information.
Starting point is 00:34:02
Why are we saying sorry? And as far as we know, a uniquely human thing, I could be wrong about this, but a colleague of mine at Stanford and psychiatrist, Carl Dyseroff talked about this, that humans are the only species that we are aware of that sheds tears for sake of emotion. Yeah.
Starting point is 00:34:24
Other animals, they have lacrimal glands. They produce, you know, water, so to speak, salty water that comes out of their eye region, but not as it relates to emotions. At least we don't think so. So that's a great example. Like I even think about a conversation I have had with my kids.
Starting point is 00:34:38
And I like to just have these moments here and there. Whenever I talk about good conversations with my kids, I think people think I have these 45 minute, no, they're usually 10 seconds. I say one thing, my kids say, can I have a snack now? And I think that's a great conversation because I know it gets in there. Do you know that tears have really important information
Starting point is 00:34:57
for us? I can be like, what, what'd you say? I'm just thinking, so many people think tears are bad. Tears are kind of amazing. It's like our body is trying to stop us and it's like asking us to pay attention to something really powerful. I just think it's kind of an amazing thing.
Starting point is 00:35:12
Our body does. And my kid goes, can I have pretzels? Oh, sure, I'll get you pretzels. That to me is a win. I just wanna tell everyone. I love it. That is a 10 out of 10. I'm bragging to people about that.
Starting point is 00:35:22
I'm like, I had the best conversation because I know this is seeping in. Because in the moment my kid is crying, you think it's gonna be helpful when my seven year old is crying, tears are amazing. They're like, F you, mom. No one wants to hear that.
Starting point is 00:35:40
My reflex would be to tell them the biology of tears. Noam Sobel, who was on the podcast, told us that tears contain hormones that signal to other people, pheromones, excuse me, that literally change the biology of the people around you. We can actually smell tears. We don't realize we're doing it. See, here I go.
Starting point is 00:35:54
So I realize you tell a kid, I spend enough time with kids that if you tell them that, they're like, whatever. But you know, and that's a great conversation, around the dinner table. And again, your kids will roll their eyes. Kids roll their eyes about everything. I always think rolling their eyes or stop
Starting point is 00:36:08
is kind of a kid's way of saying, there's a lot coming at me on my own person. I just need to push it away a little so that on my own time and under my own control, I can take it in. And we take eye rolls or whatever it is so personally that then we end up getting into a parachute, we'll go, why are you rolling my eyes?
Starting point is 00:36:25
And we miss this opportunity. If we just say nothing then, our kid is gonna take in what we just said, just walk away, let the whole process happen. You know, it's kind of like if your boss comes in and says something like, oh look, that project really wasn't as good as it could have been and I really need these things done.
Starting point is 00:36:41
And you're like, oh. And then imagine, you're rolling your eyes at me. If your boss just leaves the room. You probably think, I didn't do that as well as I could. I'm going to go work on it. Right? So I feel like not taking the bait is a very important parenting tool. But I think those moments with our kids to talk about emotions and to talk about our own, especially when it comes to struggle. One of the things I think a lot about,
Starting point is 00:37:07
I try to be intentional with my kids, especially when they're younger, I just think, kids are flooded by their parents' capability. And it is so hard to learn in environments where someone's capability is so far beyond your own. Like, I'm not a good cook, but if I was really learning to cook, where someone's capability is so far beyond your own. Like I'm not a good cook, but if I was really learning to cook, I would wanna learn from someone from here or there,
Starting point is 00:37:32
burnt some garlic or messed up the broccoli. And then it was like, okay, well, I guess I could do this next time. I'd be like, okay. But if I'm learning to cook from someone who is whatever celebrity chef, I don't know, that person's like way too far from me. And I almost feel shame.
Starting point is 00:37:49
So I think about this with our kids and how this relates to emotions. Where when your kids are younger, especially, if you just think about the first 10 minutes of their day, like they're trying to figure out maybe how to brush their teeth, how to go to the bathroom, how to turn on the sink, how to wash their hands. They always put their shirt on the wrong way.
Starting point is 00:38:04
They can't get on their socks. There's so many things. And you come out dressed perfectly. And then I can't get on my socks. And you go like this. OK, one, two. And kind of in those moments, I always think that's, I'm just kind of saying to my kid,
Starting point is 00:38:16
I can do everything easily. And they don't know our history. They don't know. We struggled to put on socks for five years, too. I put on my shirt backward, you know, until college. They don't know that. And so I think again in these calm moments you have this opportunity to say something like, I cannot finish this crossword puzzle. Or like, I love New York Times games, right? And it's so fun with my kids now that they're older, but my connections was really
Starting point is 00:38:43
hard today. I just, I really struggled with it. And then I was like, oh, I can't do it. I can't do it. And then I took a deep breath and I tried it a little more and maybe I said, and I did it, or I didn't do it, whatever it is. And it gives my kid, first of all, it gives my kid an opportunity to just notice
Starting point is 00:38:59
that I struggle too. It gives my kid again, kind of an arc and a story of, oh, someone I admire so much, every kid admires their parents. They've had hard times. They still have hard times. They work through things. They burn garlic. They can kind of talk themselves through it. That is such a more powerful kind of lesson in emotion regulation than teaching your kid kind of directly. Yeah, it also seems that here we're not defining
Starting point is 00:39:29
the age of the kids, but if one presents themselves as perfect or close to it in any kind of relationship, work, romantic, parenting, et cetera, sooner or later, you're gonna fall from grace because they're either gonna be looking for the mistake or the moment you make a mistake it's gonna be this fracture in the picture that people had of you. And I have to say, and I think some people might get irritated
Starting point is 00:39:54
or even dare I say triggered by the language I'm about to use, but I feel like the real ninja move in all of this is to acknowledge that there are power dynamics between parent and child, but then to try and dissolve the power dynamics. And I say this in the context of having run a lab for a long time, which is very different than raising small children,
Starting point is 00:40:15
but you have people who are coming into your laboratory, they are, if they're your graduate student or postdoc, they're staking their whole career on your ability to teach and mentor. And a lot is at stake. Nothing is for certain. They might not get a job, the papers might not work out. And so there's just so much tension around it.
Starting point is 00:40:33
And so as a PI, as a principal investigator in a lab, I remember feeling that pressure of like, it's gotta work out. And one of the best things that ever happened to me as a graduate student was that my first paper took forever to get accepted. And we almost got in and then it didn't get in. And then finally it got in such that every paper
Starting point is 00:40:52
after that felt like a breeze because it took so damn long the first time. And I got to see that my advisor couldn't like make magic happen. And fortunately, that's the way the scientific process is supposed to work. And I think about this in the context of parenting, like if you're seen as invincible,
Starting point is 00:41:11
you know, we hear about this, like people say, I thought my dad was Superman. I thought my mom was Superwoman, you know? But you can imagine how disappointing it must be when they discover anything about a lack of capacity or a break in emotional stability, et cetera. So how does one present themselves as both powerful in the positive sense of the word,
Starting point is 00:41:33
such a thorny word, but powerful in the positive sense of the word, but human and vulnerable to making mistakes in a way that you don't give up the essential, let's just call it what it is, a power dynamic with your kids so that the kid then doesn't feel they have to parent you. I love this topic because it's so interesting.
Starting point is 00:41:51
Right now, it's kind of review season at Good Inside because I'm also the CEO of a company. And to me, the things I talk about with parenting and my kids and for other people parenting their kids, they are the exact same principles, exact as leading a team. And so when I think about review season and the way we get feedback and the right and back and forth, it brings us all together and I'll explain.
Starting point is 00:42:16
So the other day I said to my kids, I love resolutions. I actually do love resolutions, right? Because I love just the opportunity to say, what is one small thing? I'm like, I value, and I'm gonna hold myself accountable to do. What I said to my kids was, I want you to come up with one thing,
Starting point is 00:42:36
just one thing for now. And it has to be something like manageable and real that I could do that would really make me a better mom to you. You asked your kids this. I asked my kids this. I actually asked my kids this relatively frequently. It's like a review, right?
Starting point is 00:42:53
Because it's something I do at work all the time. And what I say at work is, cause often my direct reports say nothing. I said, I just want to tell you something. I need one thing from you by the end of the day. I need it because like, I know, I know one thing from you by the end of the day. I need it because like I know, I know I can get hot. I know I can get a little reactive, right? I know I'm always go, go, go. And there probably is a moment that, you know, I need to pause. I know, I know I have
Starting point is 00:43:18
a lot of issues. So if you don't tell me one thing, I don't trust you as much. So here's what happened with my kids. At that point, it was only two of them. It just happened the other day. My son says, my seven-year-old son, sometimes when you're trying to get some work done at home and I want to get your attention for something, this is what you do, Mom. One minute, one minute, one minute, and then you still don't give me full attention.
Starting point is 00:43:42
He's clocky. He's clocky. I'd rather you tell me five minutes and't give me his full attention. He's clocky, he's clocky. I'd rather you tell me five minutes and then give me your full attention. That's literally what I would, and I was just like, that is a really good suggestion. And I really needed to hear that. I can do that.
Starting point is 00:44:00
This was a couple of days ago. Okay, I have to admit, two days ago, he was trying to show me something. He just goes, you're doing it. You're not really giving me your attention. I said, you're right. Thank you. Change is hard. I actually do need about two minutes. Is that okay? Then I'll put my computer down,
Starting point is 00:44:22
because I'll sometimes look at him and I'll look at him. He goes, okay. It was kind of it was so beautiful. My daughter said at night she goes it's so interesting when you give people this opportunity how generous they can be with you. I think it's been true at work and home. I heard her go I know when it's my bedtime at night I always want to do one or two extra things. I know I I always have to get my water. Mom, it's just how I am. That's what she said. And you get this rushing voice, and you go, come on. It's bedtime.
Starting point is 00:44:52
And that's like the last voice I hear before bed. And I really don't like that voice. And so can you just know that I always need to do those one or two extra things and not use that voice. And I said, you know what? I wouldn't want to hear that as the last voice. You know, and I think at night especially is a little digression.
Starting point is 00:45:14
I always feel like I'm in a rush. I don't know, an extra two minutes with my kids, like my kids are getting older. They're not even in my house for that much longer. I just have to remind myself, I'm not in a rush. Like this is the best use of my time. So I said, and that one I've been really good at. And so how do we show our kids that we're fallible? One way is actually like asking for feedback, especially when you have older kids. When you have a teenager, this is the
Starting point is 00:45:40
number one thing that can change things around. You know what I'm thinking about? It's hard to be a teen. And I'm definitely not a perfect parent of a teen. I'm sure you have a long list, but for right now, can you name one thing that I could do that would make me a better parent to you? And I wanna follow this through because what a lot of teens will do,
Starting point is 00:46:02
or parents will say, my teenager tells me something ridiculous. They'll say, well, you know how you make me charge my phone at 9 or 10 p.m. out of the room? You could let me sleep with my phone, which maybe is like, I'm just not going to do that. Or they'll say, you know what you could do? You could give me a thousand dollars every week for an allowance. Right. And so parents will say, my kid doesn't take it seriously. This is where like to me, one of the most important life skills, parenting, management, friendships, it doesn't matter, is differentiating someone's words on the surface from their needs or their feelings or their fears,
Starting point is 00:46:37
whatever it is underneath. And not responding to the words, but kind of cutting under them. Let's even say, I can say the phone thing. What would be so great about having your phone? Just help me understand it. I know in my head I'm never going to do it, but we don't realize just because we're not going to do something, someone asks, it doesn't mean we don't owe that person the right to try to understand why they want it.
Starting point is 00:47:00
Right? So I might just ask questions. It might probably end with, look, I actually hear what you're saying. All of your friends are on Instagram until midnight. It sounds like you legitimately do miss out on conversations. By the time you get to school, you feel out of them. I'm not even joking. I feel like if I was your age, I'd be like, that's basically the worst thing ever.
Starting point is 00:47:17
I believe you. Having your phone after X time is just one of my non-negotiables. It's actually just because I love you so much that I feel like my job is to protect you. I wonder if there is some other way that we can figure that out. Or my kid says $1,000. I might say, what would you do with $1,000? Oh, you want to go to more concerts?
Starting point is 00:47:34
Oh, your friends all get more allowance. Tell me more. No matter what your kid says to you, there's information. So I think feedback is one. I think repair is another way. Repair is the most important relationship strategy to get good at. And I just hope everyone hears the duality in that and realizes what that means because if you're gonna get good at
Starting point is 00:47:56
repair, you have to mess up. The only way to repair is to mess up. And so if I'm telling you get good at repair, I am telling you, you have to accomplish step one, which is yelling at your kid. You have to. And you're going to do it anyway. I do it. But if you then tell yourself, wait, I'm getting good at repair, step one is messing up, I crushed it, amazing, I'm half the way there. Then when you repair, which is when you take ownership, hey, I'm sorry I yelled, just like you. I'm managing my emotions. Emotions are really tricky.
Starting point is 00:48:29
Emotions are really hard. And do you know what? Even though you're gonna have a leg up on this compared to most people when they're adults, because you're learning how to regulate emotions, you're still gonna be practicing that when you're my age. That is my responsibility to work on. It's not your fault. And I love
Starting point is 00:48:46
you. So powerful. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1. AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens. AG1 is designed to cover all of your foundational nutritional needs and it tastes great. Now I've been drinking AG1 since 2012 and I started doing that at a time when my budget for supplements was really limited. In fact, I only had enough money back then
Starting point is 00:49:12
to purchase one supplement and I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1. The reason for that is even though I strive to eat most of my foods from whole foods and minimally processed foods, it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits, vegetables, vitamins and minerals, micronutrients and adaptogens
Starting point is 00:49:28
from food alone. And I need to do that in order to ensure that I have enough energy throughout the day, I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong. But when I take AG1 daily, I find that all aspects of my health, my physical health, my mental health and my performance, both cognitive and physical are better.
Starting point is 00:49:44
I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take AG1, and I certainly felt the difference. I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense given the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1, which for me means a serving in the morning or mid-morning, and again, later in the afternoon or evening,
Starting point is 00:50:00
that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy. If you'd like to try AG1, you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to claim a special offer. For this month only, January, 2025, AG1 is giving away 10 free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2. Again, go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to claim the 10 free travel packs
Starting point is 00:50:22
and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2. Today's episode is also brought to us by Juv. Juv makes medical grade red light therapy devices. Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast, it's the incredible impact that light can have on our biology. Now, in addition to sunlight,
Starting point is 00:50:39
red light and near infrared light have been shown to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health, including faster muscle recovery, improved skin health and wound healing, improvements in acne, meaning reductions in acne, reduced pain and inflammation, improved mitochondrial function, and even improving visual function itself. What sets JuveLights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use clinically proven wavelengths, meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light in specific combinations
Starting point is 00:51:08
to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations. Personally, I use the JOOVE whole body panel about three to four times per week, typically in the morning, but sometimes in the afternoon. And I use the JOOVE handheld light both at home and when I travel. If you'd like to try JOOVE, you can go to JOOVE, spell J-O-O-V-V dot com slash Huberman.
Starting point is 00:51:26
Juv is offering an exclusive discount to all Huberman Lab listeners with up to $400 off select Juv products. Again, that's Juv, J-O-O-V-V dot com slash Huberman to get up to $400 off. I love, love, love this thing about asking for a request. It's different than asking for feedback, which could quickly lead to a list of all the things that one does wrong as opposed to a request for how one could do better. Yeah.
Starting point is 00:51:54
So I think there's an important distinction there. And then it seems that the question that the parent or who knows the boss or whatever, maybe it's with a romantic partner, needs to ask themselves is, what is this request really about? Like what's underneath it? I'm just paraphrasing essentially what you said.
Starting point is 00:52:12
And what's it really about? Is it a request for more autonomy, for more social connection with other people? And then one starts to realize it, certainly in this example that you gave of a child asking for more time with their phone late at night is that it actually has nothing to do with your relationship to them.
Starting point is 00:52:30
It's really about their relationship to their friends. Yeah, could be. And the fact that they might feel as if they're missing out. Yeah. And that leads me to another question, which is what if you as the parent, partner, boss, et cetera, keep your phone close to you until midnight.
Starting point is 00:52:47
And they know that. So one of the worst things that I believe anyone can say is, you know, do as I say, not as I do. It's just such a blatantly arrogant stance of you're supposed to do what I say because I say so, but I'm not gonna do it because I don't want to. And yet there are times like in parent-child relationships or boss-employee relationships where you're telling somebody
Starting point is 00:53:10
to do something and you yourself are not going to do it or no longer do it or choose not to do it. And in reality, you don't have to. And maybe there's a good reason why you don't or don't have to. That's the nature of, that's why I use these words, power dynamics, which everyone hears and goes, oh boy, here we go. But it is an issue of power dynamics.
Starting point is 00:53:30
You have more power than the kid. So what you're doing is you're giving the kid power to express where they want more agency. I like the word maybe agency more than power. Did you grant your son the right to use his phone later into the evening? My son, my son has- Not to pry into your personal-
Starting point is 00:53:49
My son did not ask me that. Oh, okay, sorry. And he knows that our phone rules are non-negotiables. No, I didn't mean to pry into your family dynamics, but- No, but that kid, if that's a rule, you would never give it to them. But I think so many times, and then we'll go back to power, we shouldn't be afraid to learn more.
Starting point is 00:54:06
I actually just think that's what it is. Our kid says, oh, my friends get this. That's not true. Why don't you just learn more? Oh, they do? It's like learning more about what someone says doesn't mean you ever have to change your boundary. Most of conflict is about a lack of understanding anyway.
Starting point is 00:54:22
When you learn more, you're trying to understand, understand your kid, understand someone wants to raise and you think it's ridiculous. You can learn more. Tell me what's been going on. What have you been doing? Learning more about someone's position does not weaken your position. And I think that's really, really important in any form of leadership. Now, in terms of the power dynamics, there is something about the word power that like, you know, yeah, I mean, I think the way I think about it and what we do at Good Insight a lot in terms of our leadership and parenting style, I don't use the word power, but I think it's about embodying your authority. Parents have authority. Pilots have authority. Bosses have authority because they're the ones kind
Starting point is 00:55:07
of who have the job of setting up the whole system for success. That's their job, right? My job isn't to make my kid happy. My job is to help create the conditions for my kid to be like a real functioning, confident adult, that's what I believe, right? A pilot's job is definitely not to keep passengers happy. it's to get everyone safely on the ground. A boss's job is not to keep everyone happy, it's to set up the conditions for health and success of the business. Now if you know that's your job, it's no one else's job but the CEO.
Starting point is 00:55:36
I mean, to some degree, all the management, but that is their job. And so there's a difference where if the CEO believes a job needs to be done a certain way It's not that they have power It's just their role involves having that authority and if someone else disagrees It's up to them to say you can keep the job or not. It's just a different you have different roles So and I actually think owning that very outright It's actually something I recently said at work in a review around something I really wanted and kind of owned like in my role as a CEO. Like that is under my role
Starting point is 00:56:13
to decide this is important. And now we have to figure it out. Let's see. I would love some input on how we're going to get this done. Same thing for a kid. One of the lines I said over and over and over to my kid when they were younger, and I see so many good inside parents tell me that their kids reflect back to them later, is my number one job is to keep you safe. So what does that mean? That kind of relates to power.
Starting point is 00:56:36
It can mean, why am I not letting my kid, I don't know, jump up and down on our kitchen counter? It's not because I'm pissed that my kid isn't listening. I'm not letting them jump up and down on our kitchen counter. It's not cause I'm pissed that my kid isn't listening. I'm not letting them jump up and down on my kitchen counter where there's a light above their head because my number one job is to keep my kid safe. Is that power? I mean, I guess I think it's authority.
Starting point is 00:56:57
How would I embody that authority? I would say, it looks hard for you to get down. I'm about to pick you up and put you on the floor because I have authority, right? We get to this phone discussion, let's say, and I really do believe that the phone has to be charged out of the room at a certain time. I'm gonna understand, I'm gonna understand,
Starting point is 00:57:15
I'm gonna listen, hopefully I'm connected to my kid and they feel respected by me in a million ways. And it might lead to me saying, look, my number one job still is to keep you safe and that really means making decisions that I really believe are good for you, short term and long term, even if you're upset with me. This is one of those times. And so I love you. This might be a point of conflict. I know we're going to get through this. And that is my role as a parent. And it comes from a place of wanting to protect you.
Starting point is 00:57:46
And I think when you embody your authority in that way, kids never say thank you, and they will roll their eyes. And kids always feel loved and protected. They really do. I hear it from my kids. You know, maybe this is so true. Sometimes things happen with my kids, and I'm like, no one's gonna even believe this. But I was walking with my seven-year-old the other day,
Starting point is 00:58:07
and I said, what does it mean to be a good parent? What does it really mean? I'm curious. He really thought, means you're kind of strict. And I said, what do you mean strict? Because you have certain rules that you think matter. And he goes, but it also means,
Starting point is 00:58:29
like you also have to be loving and fun. And my heart like hurts hearing, like myself say this like in a good way, like they know, I think kids know. And maybe he says that because that's what we are, but I think kids know. And I can't even tell you how many kids I used to work with, and teens especially, the pain of their parents not embodying their authority was so clear.
Starting point is 00:58:54
They knew that they shouldn't be out at a certain time. They knew that they were hanging out with kids who were like bad news and their parents had no idea and they felt unanchored. Like they really, really knew not that their parents weren't exerting power. That word isn't, their parents weren't embodying their appropriate authority to protect their kids. I had something come to mind, which is not a phrase
Starting point is 00:59:18
that I've ever used before or heard before. But what comes to mind is kind of statements of stance. Yes. I feel like statements of stance in parent-child relationships, families, workplace, romantic relationships, et cetera, are great when they're about actions or about sort of overriding themes like no matter what, I'm trying to keep you safe. I might not get everything right, but that is non-negotiable internally, and I'm gonna try and make it non-negotiable externally.
Starting point is 00:59:50
Like it's a statement of stance about actions. Or keeping you healthy and safe is my number one priority. Those are facts. Those are things that one can really say and believe and until the end of time, be trying to incorporate into one's behavior. But I feel like statements of stance about emotions are very dangerous.
Starting point is 01:00:10
Like, we don't yell in this house. You know, it's okay to cry, right? There's always a caveat. Of course it's okay to cry, right? But there are times when crying is less appropriate. There's times when caveat, of course it's okay to cry, right? But there are times when crying is less appropriate. There's times when yelling might be appropriate. There's times when emotions need to be expressed
Starting point is 01:00:33
or not expressed in a particular way, because look, I don't think I'm alone in thinking that, the kid tantruming in a public environment is an embarrassing thing for them, for their parent, for people around, and it's not the end of the world, right? That's a tantrum for goodness sake, right? Like people will survive. But I feel like statements of stance about emotions
Starting point is 01:00:55
kind of hold us to this standard that we'll never be able to meet. But that statements of stance about action are, you know, till we fail and, you know, until we fail and, you know, hope we don't, we can say things like, you know, my job is always to keep you safe. I'm always going to try and make the best decision for you and for your sister, for instance.
Starting point is 01:01:18
But I think that many people, I'm not just speaking from my own experience, but in talking to friends and others that they grew up in homes where there were these philosophies, these statements of stance. And the moment that things didn't match that statement of stance, the whole concept of what parents and children
Starting point is 01:01:35
are supposed to be about just kind of started to dissolve. And it creates that underlying fear. Do they even really know what they're doing? Or maybe they don't know what they're doing, Or maybe they don't know what they're doing, but maybe they're trying. So in any case, it's just something that maybe we could talk about for a moment. I have some reactions to that.
Starting point is 01:01:52
I kind of think you're talking about values and principles. And so I think there are, in my house, to be honest, it's not like we have some wall of like, these are our family values. I've seen those in people's homes. That's not organized mean, some families might do this. I've seen those in people's homes. Yeah, that's not. Yeah, on the refrigerator. Not organized enough to do that.
Starting point is 01:02:08
But if I thought about a couple that come to mind, like my job is to keep my kids safe. By the way, safe does not mean they're never in a situation without risk. That's not what I mean. You know, but in general. That's its own form of danger. Exactly, the minimization of risk is also not safe, right?
Starting point is 01:02:25
But in general, my job is to keep you safe. I'm not going to let you do things that endanger yourself or others. So that's one. Another principle I think about is I will always tell you the truth even if it's uncomfortable. You can always count on me for that. We call that, I call that truth over comfort, right? So if my kid says to me, how are babies made? That value is useful, right? Another thing is like all feelings are allowed. Not all behaviors are okay, right? Stuff like that. What about we don't swear in this house?
Starting point is 01:02:58
So what I was about to say- And then you're on the phone and then you screw up and then the kid goes, you swore. To me, what's very different is these kind of rigidities around behavior. We don't swear. Swearing is a behavior. We don't cry in public behavior. We don't tantrum here.
Starting point is 01:03:14
That's a behavior. Behaviors all the time are a manifestation of feelings that overpower skills. So saying we don't do certain behaviors, to me, it doesn't even make logical sense. Well, what if I'm in a situation where I have a really intense emotion and don't have the skill to manage it?
Starting point is 01:03:31
We don't, the behavior is gonna happen and then I feel like a bad person. That's very different than values around intention. I want to be truthful with my kids even if things are uncomfortable. I might fumble around with the words, right? I might even sometimes lie because I didn't do that value in action. But what I can come back to is, okay, nobody lives their values 100% of the time.
Starting point is 01:03:55
So I think we're talking about actually something core to what we think about at Good Inside, which is I'm a good person with values who is totally imperfect and sometimes acts in ways I'm not proud of. Both are true. When families have values that are very behavior-based, what ends up happening in the kids is they start to equate certain behaviors with morality. These are good behaviors that make me loved in my family, and these are bad behaviors that kind of make me feel like I'm not the right part of my family. And they even make me wonder, like, am I lovable? Am I good inside
Starting point is 01:04:29
after all? Am I worthy? That's not good. Because whenever we tie behavior to identity, that's shame. And we've tried to motivate kids with shame for hundreds and hundreds of years, and it does not work and causes a lot of problems. I think another one which is interesting, especially as my kids get older, I said this to my teen recently, is this is really tricky. One of my jobs, as always, has been to create guidelines
Starting point is 01:04:56
and rules with you, you know? It's always gonna be kind of collaborative. Some, because of my authority, will be directive that I believe are gonna keep you safe. I think this really relates to a phone. I wanna tell you another part of my job that might sound contradictory, but I actually think we just need to hold them both at once.
Starting point is 01:05:11
Another part of my job is to be there for you when you inevitably go against those guidelines. And I want you to know that. We have rules around what can and cannot be done online. And I'll say this here, and if you do kind of become part of a really inappropriate text conversation, if there is bullying,
Starting point is 01:05:33
if you do come across some images online that make you feel really uncomfortable and you're like, I shouldn't have seen that, you're not getting in trouble with me. I'm not gonna throw you a party. I will be there for you to help you through those moments. Those things sound contradictory, and in our family we know two things can be true,
Starting point is 01:05:50
and those are both true, right? To me, that's a really important thing for a teenager to know. Let's talk about guilt and shame. Yes. I've heard some kind of catchphrase-y stuff, not from you, but like, oh, you know, guilt is about the thing you did
Starting point is 01:06:05
and shame is a feeling about who we are. And, you know, while I'm not against those sort of 1990s, early 2000s kind of psychology-isms, I feel like they're not very useful. In the same way that hearing that there's a gap between stimulus and response. And if you identify that gap, well, then goodness, you're gonna be the kind of person that can feel stressed, but not be reactive.
Starting point is 01:06:26
You're gonna be responsive, not reactive. That's just a bunch of words that doesn't, here I'm a biologist, so I'll just say, doesn't take into account the fact that the biology of stress changes your perception of time and a whole bunch of other things that basically make that gap between stimulus and response much, much smaller.
Starting point is 01:06:46
And I think once people understand that, they go, oh, so like the kitchen refrigerator magnet or the poster on the wall that says, you know, like there's a gap between stimulus and response, it was supposed to save me, but it didn't, of course not. Like we're just in different states of mind at different times. So how do you define, no pressure here, but how do you define, no pressure here,
Starting point is 01:07:05
but how do you define guilt versus shame? Great. And what about guilt and shame? Great, two of my favorite topics. I have a couple of different ways of defining things. I'm like you, to me, I like defining things in ways that are very concrete and very usable. That's all.
Starting point is 01:07:23
And if there's multiple ways of doing that, that's great. So the way I think about guilt, and this will probably set us off in a direction about what is not guilt also, is guilt is a feeling I have when I act out of alignment with my values. And in that way, guilt is a really useful feeling. Real useful, because it makes me reflect on,
Starting point is 01:07:45
wait, I didn't act in line with my values. I wonder why. What would I have had to do differently? What got in my way? Well, I'm so glad I have that information from my body to have this deeply uncomfortable feeling to set in that process, right? So if I yell at my kid, I'm gonna feel guilty, right?
Starting point is 01:08:02
I think about a time when my kid told me, you know, I lied to you. I did take that eraser from that kid in school and I feel really guilty. And I said, first of all, I'm so glad you told me that. I'm so glad you're feeling guilty. That's the right way to feel. Now, there must've been something so hard
Starting point is 01:08:20
about seeing something so shiny and fun that you don't have. I totally get that. And you're right, that's not in your values to take it. So that's a useful feeling. That feeling is gonna help you not do something like that again. Let's figure out what you can do. Not just to say sorry, this is what parents miss. You know what's gonna happen another time?
Starting point is 01:08:39
You're gonna see something else pretty cool. Someone's cubby. And you know what most people think? I'm gonna take that. You're gonna have to talk again. I would too. What can you do the next time you have that thought? All of this comes because of guilt. Useful feeling. Guilt is a feeling you have when you act out of alignment with your values. Now to me, guilt is one of the most misunderstood feelings because what you hear all the time
Starting point is 01:09:03
and you'll hear how much it kind of conflicts with this definition is something like this. I haven't seen my friends in years. There's finally a dinner, but it would require me not to put my kid down to sleep. And if I'm talking to someone I'd say, okay, well, I'm guessing you're not leaving your kid alone. Now again, my husband or my mom, someone who's a totally safe adult. But Becky, I told my kid and she was clinging to me like, no, mommy, I needed to be you,
Starting point is 01:09:34
I needed to be you. And so I'm not going to dinner. Do you know what I'm going to say, Andrew? Because I feel so guilty. This is, right. Oh, someone asked me to be in the PTA meeting. I'm so guilty. This is, right. Oh, someone asked me to be in the PTA meeting. I'm so busy. I can't, but I can't do it because I feel so guilty.
Starting point is 01:09:51
Okay. Again, I'm just curious. I say, well, it sounds like you really want to go to dinner with your friends. She's like, oh, I do. All I do is parent these days. I literally haven't seen these friends in years. They're in town.
Starting point is 01:10:03
And she's like, tell me about your friendships. I asked him, do I value my... Yes. I know that I'm kind of more than just someone who puts down my kid for bed. And I love doing that, but this matters too. So I said, this is really interesting. You really value your friendships. Your life right now feels out of balance in that your friendships, that part of your burner
Starting point is 01:10:23
of your stove is like really low. Okay. And you're not going because you feel guilty. I just want to share an idea. Guilt is a feeling you have when you act out of alignment with your values. It seems like going to dinner would be in line with your values and almost, it's like, yeah, it's true. So what is this feeling?
Starting point is 01:10:40
And here's what I think the feeling is. I call it not guilt just because I haven't figured out a more sophisticated term, but here's what I think the feeling is. I call it not guilt just because I haven't figured out a more sophisticated term, but here's what I think is happening. A lot of us, especially women, when we were growing up, we learned to notice everyone's feelings around us. And we learned that our value, really, and our worth, really. And we were kind of best and good girls when we took care of everyone else's feelings except for our own. I think so many young girls especially become expert at what people need of them by becoming distant from what they need for
Starting point is 01:11:24
themselves. The picture I get in my mind is sort of like having antennae cast in every direction. That's right. Except perhaps at the exclusion of paying attention to the antennae that are inward. Exactly. And we are, you know, attentional resources are finite. I mean, we just don't have the capacity to like respond to other people's emotions and feel at the same time to the same degree that we would have we just concentrated
Starting point is 01:11:48
on theirs or our emotions. I mean, that's just a fact of how humans work. Yeah, and kids are oriented by attachment. They have to learn with their families, how do I become the most lovable, safest version of myself? So I have a friend who, it's true, I remember her. Even in middle school, I can't come. My dad's traveling and my mom really needs me to stay home and watch a movie with her, right?
Starting point is 01:12:08
And I know this mom well, it's like oh, you don't love me. You don't write I mean this was so she became expert at always noticing other people's emotions and not only noticing them Taking the emotions from them kind of like taking them into their body and almost metabolizing them for them. That's not guilt. That is taking someone else's emotions and taking them into your body at the expense of taking care of your own needs. And so I have a visual for this because I think it's really powerful where, let's say it's the situation where a mom is saying, I really wanna go out to dinner, but I feel so guilty. First thing is just powerful to say, that is not guilt. It is something else and it is real and it is powerful,
Starting point is 01:12:53
but it is not guilt. What is happening? I'm on one side of a tennis court, like me and you, Andrew, but let's say it's a tennis court and you're on the other side or even in between and instead of a net, it's like a glass table. Over here, I am here in my desire to go out with my friends because I do value my friendships.
Starting point is 01:13:13
Okay, over there is you're upset about it. And let's say instead you're my daughter, you're like, no, no, don't go. No one else can put me to bed. That is definitely hard to deal with, but that is your daughter's feelings. Those are not your feelings. Those are your daughter's feelings.
Starting point is 01:13:29
And some of us slash a lot of us have developed this tendency where we're on this court and all of a sudden all those feelings from your side somehow go through that wall and they come to your side and you call it guilt. It is not guilt. And to me, one of the most liberating things, and this actually relates to empathy, as I always say, is to give that feeling back to its rightful owner.
Starting point is 01:13:52
Because what that means is if I really give it back, now I have a boundary. That's my kid's feeling. That's not mine. And I can now actually empathize. People said, no, I was empathizing. I wasn't going out. No, no, no, no. That's not empathy.
Starting point is 01:14:07
You weren't going out with your friends because you couldn't handle the distress in your body. You just made your daughter's feelings your own. You just engaged in something almost selfish. This has nothing to do with your daughter. In those situations, that's why we say weird things to our four-year-old. Like, don't you want Mommy to have friends?
Starting point is 01:14:22
I feel like, why are you asking me that question? It's like a pilot being like, don't you want mommy to have friends? I feel like, why are you asking me that question? It's like a pilot being like, don't you want me to make an emergency landing? Like, if you need to make an emergency landing, don't ask me for permission. Because once I give it back to my daughter, I can do this. I can say, you really wish I would put you to bed tonight. You're right, it feels so different when Grandma does it.
Starting point is 01:14:42
Oh, it does. I'm going out. It's OK if you're upset. Oh, it does. I'm going out. It's okay if you're upset. I'll be back and I'll kiss you and I'll see you in the morning. And then this next part is so important. When you walk out, I don't want any person having any illusion that the daughter's gonna be like,
Starting point is 01:15:00
yes, you go girl. No, she is going to scream. That's okay. Going back to the boundary. You're allowed to take care of your needs. And other people are allowed to be inconvenienced and upset by it. It doesn't mean your needs are wrong.
Starting point is 01:15:19
It doesn't mean their feelings are wrong. And it definitely doesn't mean you feel guilty. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need but nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium and potassium all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
Starting point is 01:15:39
Proper hydration is critical for optimal brain and body function. Even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish cognitive and physical performance. It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes. The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body, especially your neurons or your nerve cells. Drinking element dissolved in water makes it extremely easy to ensure that you're getting
Starting point is 01:16:00
adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes. To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts of hydration and electrolytes, I dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning, and I drink that basically first thing in the morning. I also drink element dissolved in water
Starting point is 01:16:15
during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing, especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot, and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes. They have a bunch of different great tasting flavors of Element. They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera. Frankly, I love them all. And now that we're in the winter months
Starting point is 01:16:30
in the Northern hemisphere, Element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock. I really like the chocolate flavors, especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up, so you put it in hot water. And that's a great way to replenish electrolytes and hydrate, especially when it's cold and dry outside, when hydration is especially critical.

Starting point is 01:17:04
with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. Now I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night. That's truly the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance. And one of the best ways to ensure that you get a great night's sleep
Starting point is 01:17:19
is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase about one to three degrees. Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to control the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle, and end of the night. I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for nearly four years now,
Starting point is 01:17:45
and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep. 8Sleep has now launched their newest generation of the pod cover, the Pod4 Ultra. The Pod4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity, higher fidelity sleep tracking technology, and even has snoring detection that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
Starting point is 01:18:02
to improve your airflow and stop your snoring. If you'd like to try an eight sleep mattress cover, go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman to save up to $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra. Eightsleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com slash Huberman. Wow.
Starting point is 01:18:24
I say wow because I think the lens that you're looking at guilt through and the way you're defining it is so very different than the way it's been discussed ever. And I think this is a super, super important topic. So I'd like to lathe into it a little bit more. In some ways, the way that I think many people experience guilt, at least according to your definition, which by the way, I love, it's when we act out of alignment with our values versus feeling pressure.
Starting point is 01:18:57
Like I think about, I mean, Lord knows I don't have the best reputation as having a short text response latency. It's variable. Sometimes I'm quick on the draw and other times I'm like, oh goodness, it'll be days or weeks. I mean, over the holidays, I was spooling through it. I would respond to people like a week later
Starting point is 01:19:14
and I do my best, but I do often feel, quote unquote, guilty about not being as responsive in text to a number of people because I care about them. I value them. But I get overwhelmed by text messaging very easily to the point where I have to put my phones out of the room when I work, et cetera. So the way I experience a bunch of text messages coming in
Starting point is 01:19:40
is as pressure that then I feel guilty. I'm not trying to make this about me, but- No, I want to, let's go into this. I have a lot to say. I feel quote unquote guilty, but do I really feel, but what's interesting is, you know, I believe in cognitive dissonance. And then what I notice is that then my brain
Starting point is 01:19:55
tries to bridge that gap. I come up with these like justifications with like, well, when I text people and they don't respond for like two weeks, I don't get upset, which is true, unless it's in a particular sort of category of circumstances. So how come the way they view this whole dynamic is not the same as the way I view this dynamic? Maybe this is a more male-centric view
Starting point is 01:20:13
as opposed to feeling porous, like I feel they're upset. But I will say, in fairness to all the chromosomes and their arrangements, I do feel bad. Like it sucks. Like I love these people and they're reaching out to say whatever, happy new year or something. And I'm feeling pressure as opposed to feeling how wonderful it is to have people in my life.
Starting point is 01:20:35
So here, this is such a beautiful example where I'd ask myself or I'd ask you to ask yourself, okay, you already named one of your values, which is interesting. I really value my relationships. You said that. Okay, that's one value. And I think this is, I'm gonna ask you this question.
Starting point is 01:20:51
Do you value quick responses all the time from you on text message? Is that a value of yours? From me or to me? From you. Do I value always responding to people on text right away? The truth is, if I'm really honest, I hate shallow exchange of any kind,
Starting point is 01:21:11
except maybe a fist bump to somebody you just kind of feel some kinship with on the street and you have that connecting and you just give them the fist bump, great. But I like more in-depth, lengthy connection. Like three hour long conversation? Three hour long conversations or drop, a friend came by the other day for New Year's.
Starting point is 01:21:29
He was on my list of people that, and yes, I made a list of people that I want to deepen my friendship with in the New Year. He came by, we had a two hour lunch, we chatted, and I feel like it was awesome and worth a million single line text messages. And I'm also the kind of person where like, I'm good to not see him for a while,
Starting point is 01:21:48
not because I'm tired of him, but because I also have other friends and things to do. So I'm more of a depth, not breadth kind of guy. This is to me, this is such a powerful process. And then after this, I kind of want to link it back to how I've actually told my kids about why I do go out to dinner with friends, right? So I value deep relationships.
Starting point is 01:22:07
I value relationships. I value deep relationships. And if I'm honest with myself, responding to someone right away, it's actually not my value. But again, we can hold multiple things at once. That doesn't mean I don't care about those people. And I just laid out all my values.
Starting point is 01:22:20
What I think is so powerful as a not guilt diffuser is naming this directly to the people. So it doesn't have to be on text, but you're seeing person X and you know, I'm never that good. I just want to tell you, I really value our friendship. I really value these times we have together. Something I just also want to get off my chest
Starting point is 01:22:39
is going back and forth quickly on text. That's not something that's easy for me that I do very often. And so you might text me and it might take me a while. And I just wanted to name that to you, right? Now, look, someone else always has the right to say, well, that's interesting, that doesn't work for me. And one of my top values with friends
Starting point is 01:22:58
is someone who's always getting back and forth. To me, that's actually great, great. Now we know, okay, what are we gonna do about that? That's fine, you know where someone stands. And the reason I relate this to the situation with going to dinner is I remember early on when my daughter said, why do you have to go to dinner with friends?
Starting point is 01:23:14
Or why do you and dad, this is it, why do you and dad go to dinner without us? I know the couple you're going out with, you both have kids, why can't you bring us, right? And this is where we say we feel guilt, but we don't, because I'm like, time out. She's feeling this feeling, not me. And also, I don't need her permission or approval.
Starting point is 01:23:34
That's the real parentified thing. We go to our seven-year-old and we're like, don't you want me to have adult conversations? Again, not- That's not an atypical response. I've heard parents do that. Say that. Like, don't you want me to have a social life?
Starting point is 01:23:45
But you know what it is? It is asking your kid to do your job for you. Again, can you imagine a pilot say, do you think we should make an emergency landing? You'd be, that's how a kid feels when they're asked that. They're like, why are you asking me that? Here's what I said to my daughter in that situation. I really did. I want to tell you something. I love being your mom. I really do. It's one of the most
Starting point is 01:24:09
important things in my life. I also really like being married to dad and I really like the times we have when it's just us and other adults. That's really important. I remember saying this maybe I was really trying to double down. We actually, we had that before you guys were here. You know, I think- And they're like, what? Yeah, exactly. And so one of the reasons, I wanna be honest with you, why do we go to dinner without you?
Starting point is 01:24:36
It's not so much we go to dinner without you. We think of it as going to dinner with each other and just adults. Is that something we really enjoy? It's really important to us. It's a really important part of us. And that's why, like being really vocal about your values, as opposed to looking to your child unconsciously
Starting point is 01:24:58
to give you permission to have those values, if you wanna use power, that's a power, that's a power move. And it's amazing, this is true at any time in life. The more you can locate someone, the more you respect their boundaries. I use that word a lot, you know, like, locate. I'm sure you know people in your life, like, can I locate them? You kind of know who they are. You know what they value.
Starting point is 01:25:21
And you respect them, right? When you can't locate someone, you feel very uneasy around them. You're kind of like, where are you? Who are you? What do you stand for? And as you can see with my daughter, it wasn't saying something mean. I was saying something true. And so I think with the friendships and when you say, is this guilty, it's like, well,
Starting point is 01:25:42
maybe my step and my action is just actually being honest with this person. I'm not very good at responding right away. I want to let you know I deeply care about our friendship. I'm not very good at responding to kind of small talk over text. And I just wanted to let you know that so you didn't misinterpret it. Like, I wonder what would happen. I wonder if people would kind of respond really positively.
Starting point is 01:26:04
I love it. And I can't help but recall when I was a kid, after dinner, my dad would sometimes take a walk by himself. Now, granted he's a physicist and he's a theoretical physicist, so he's like all his experiments were in his head. And he did work on paper too. But so he would take these walks.
Starting point is 01:26:22
And occasionally I'd see him coming back from these walks and he'd be smoking a cigar, something he doesn't do anymore, unfortunately. I'm grateful that he's very robust. He was actually a guest on the podcast recently, talked about science and life, et cetera. And one of the things that I remember thinking and still to this day, think and feel is,
Starting point is 01:26:41
it's kind of awesome how he takes this walk and he looked like so happy with the cigar and his thoughts and he'd walk. And I wanted to be on those walks with him. He was very, very busy. In fact, I wanted a lot more time from him than I got. It's kind of interesting because now it's oftentimes that I'm the busier one,
Starting point is 01:26:57
the tables turn, kids. But in all seriousness, I didn't think of it as self-care, but it was so clear that that was his time. That was absolutely his time. And I knew when I could and should join for things and when I didn't. And so when you say the more you can locate someone, the more you respect their values,
Starting point is 01:27:18
I feel like bells go off. It's like exactly that. And there are other examples of my mom, et cetera, but it's kind of interesting when we see somebody, adult or child, like really in their element of their thing. It's almost like we love them for it and through it. And it fills us, I think, with a healthy sense of safety.
Starting point is 01:27:40
Like they're right there. Kind of like the pilot flying the plane really well. Actually, we don't really want to know about the pilot. I want to hear the thing at the beginning, we're about ready to take off. I actually don't like it when we're landing and they say, we'll be on the ground in just a few moments. I'm like, we're at 10,000 feet.
Starting point is 01:27:53
Can we make it a little bit longer than that? But you get the point, which is that I don't want to hear from the pilot. I just want the pilot to fly the plane. You want the pilot to do their job. And again, in these, you know, I think I have so many pilot metaphors around sturdy leadership, and I think it really is such a metaphor for how we teach people the skills they need to parent. Because again, no one becomes a pilot overnight.
Starting point is 01:28:16
No one becomes a CEO overnight. No one becomes a lawyer overnight or a professional basketball player. You know, I think we actually laud CEOs these days who say, I don't know how to do leadership as well as I'd want to. I'm getting executive coach. You all want to work for that person, right? The amazing athletes in the world get amazing coaches
Starting point is 01:28:35
and they go to amazing training camps because they're amazing, right? And so I just, somehow with parenting, it's like the last area where people think I should become an amazing parent overnight. I shouldn't have to invest in skills or education. Even people who invest in skills and education for every other area of their life
Starting point is 01:28:52
that they probably care about less, there's so much shame we've internalized that we should be able to do it naturally. And you do become a parent overnight. You become a parent overnight. You do, yes. I'll remember my graduate advisor who had two kids while I was working in the lab,
Starting point is 01:29:05
saying that there were all these books back then about pregnancy. And she was like, it's wild. There are all these things of what you should eat and shouldn't eat and how you should, you and your partner and how you should prepare for the birth and all this. And then they're like,
Starting point is 01:29:17
and then at the hospital they're like, here. And you're like, ah. Now granted that was in, you know, the early 2000s. That's still what it is. And they're like, what do you need? And they go, you need a car seat to leave the hospital, which by the way, you definitely need. That's all?
Starting point is 01:29:29
Like just a car seat? Like, how am I supposed to manage this? Because the thing I want parents to know, because again, there's just so much shame and maybe we should talk about shame, right? Is the only thing that comes naturally when it comes to parenting is how you were parented. That comes naturally.
Starting point is 01:29:47
That lives in your bones. That lives in your circuits. And there might be some people who say, amazing, I have the greatest privilege in the world. Then what will come naturally is exactly what I value and what I want to do. I would say more often, people would say some version of definitely not what I want to do or parts I'll take, parts I want to do differently. And to me, it's kind of like if you were brought up speaking English and you really want to speak Mandarin or you want to speak Mandarin half the time to your kid and someone said,
Starting point is 01:30:15
are you going to learn Mandarin naturally? I feel like someone's saying, how does one learn Mandarin naturally? You would, I don't know, you'd probably sign up for, you know, Duolingo. You'd find an app or something or a course and you'd then practice and practice and you'd be able to make progress because you actually learn something new. And so I just think big picture, like parents are, they're so under-equipped and set up to feel, and this is, I think has to do with shame, that when my kids are struggling, or when I'm yelling a lot,
Starting point is 01:30:50
it means something is wrong with me or something is wrong with my kid. I feel like these days in almost every area, if a CEO is saying, I feel like I'm struggling, is it my fault or my employee's fault? They probably say, I don't know, there's probably people around who can help me, who can teach me, why do I keep yelling, right?
Starting point is 01:31:09
And same thing with almost every other field. And to me more than like if there's any legacy I get to leave in this world, it's not even the approach itself, even though I think our approach to parenting is very different. I just want parents to know, like there is no shame
Starting point is 01:31:26
in investing and learning and growing in parenting. And to look at that, like they probably look at every other year of their life. I assure you that your legacy extends far beyond that, but includes it as well. You've had a tremendous impact and continue to. I mean, it wasn't long ago that, you know, the power dynamics of parent-child relationships
Starting point is 01:31:47
where, you know, you do what I say and I'm the parent, you're the kid, and like that kind of thing. And I grew up in a different era. I'm 49 now and I've been wanting to say I'm 49 now so that I can actually say something with having had some experience when things were truly very different.
Starting point is 01:31:59
They were just so different. It was like you took what you got and you worked with it and, you know, things are so different thanks to your part in all of this. And one thing I do wanna return to because I realized I took us off track with it is this idea of kids, but perhaps adults as well, feeling or thinking they feel someone else's feelings,
Starting point is 01:32:24
taking that on, this difference between real guilt and gosh, it's really hard to come up with a word for it. At one moment I thought, well, maybe it's faux guilt, but no, you're not pretending, you're actually feeling something which feels like guilt, smells like guilt, tastes like guilt. Someone said codependence.
Starting point is 01:32:40
I don't know that much about that word, but something like that. Yeah, it's a whole landscape. Yes, exactly. It's a whole landscape. But one practice that I'm familiar with that I know exists in a couple of different realms of what's called modern psychology tools
Starting point is 01:32:57
is this idea of creating a frame separation. So like after you come together with somebody, say to like do therapy or something, or you've had sort of an emotional bind or entanglement, doesn't have to be negative, that one way that you can learn over time to differentiate their needs and wants from your needs and wants is this idea of in your head,
Starting point is 01:33:22
I know it sounds kind of corny, but there's a clear neuroscientific basis for this, at least to my understanding, of in your head, you say, for instance, like if we had just done this, like we had some resonance around something, maybe an argument, okay, like Dr. Becky and I got into a fight, that in order to really be able
Starting point is 01:33:35
to move away from that and see it clearly, how much of that was yours, how much of that was mine, there's this idea that you tell yourself, okay, what are five ways in which you and I are clearly distinct entities? So you say, and I know this folks might chuckle at this, but you say like, okay, I'm a man, you're a woman. I live in California.
Starting point is 01:33:52
Dr. Becky lives in New York. Could even make it like first person. You say like, or third person rather, you can say, I, Andrew Huberman, I'm wearing a black shirt and a black over shirt and Dr. Becky is wearing black and white. Okay, so some people might think like, what's the use of that?
Starting point is 01:34:08
But to me as a neuroscientist, whoever came up with that, and it wasn't me, is nothing short of brilliant, because the brain organizes emotions in these broader schemas of physical objects and physical distance and distance in time. And that's the way that we can differentiate between ourselves and everything around us. And there's the way that we can differentiate between ourselves and everything around us. And there's a whole discussion to be had about this.
Starting point is 01:34:27
But so it's something that I've been playing with a little bit, because I don't claim to be this ultra empath or anything, but I think it's clear that sometimes we take in our thoughts and feelings about what other people are feeling, sometimes accurate, sometimes not, and it can become very difficult. Whether or not someone's a, one of these,
Starting point is 01:34:53
I guess you call it deeply feeling, deeply feeling kids, or not. I mean, anytime you get into an emotional resonance, good or bad, I think it's, we're porous, we're porous. And that's part of what makes humans so beautiful. But I found that practice to be very useful. Even if it's just in my own head, like they're over there and I'm over here, but not even necessarily pushing
Starting point is 01:35:15
off them, but thinking like, oh, like I'm me and you're you. And there are a bunch of ways in which we differ in time and space. And I think the nervous system comes to understand that as a felt thing, as opposed to just a statement. Like, hey, like you own your emotions, I'll own mine. That's just a statement. Is this any of this?
Starting point is 01:35:36
I've never heard of that, but I love that. And it is in parallel, I think, with so many of the things I teach parents. So even the idea of locating someone, to me, like my version of people in my life that I know and love, even if I don't agree with anything they say that I can locate, they're like an egg with a shell.
Starting point is 01:35:54
They have a shell. There's like a, there's a boundary. We're really talking about boundaries. We all have different levels of porousness to the external world. And I think if you know, and there's pros and cons of both, like I really mean this, I am not terribly porous to other people's experiences.
Starting point is 01:36:12
I really have solid boundaries. There are definitely moments in my closest relationships because what people will say to me, okay, like I know these are my feelings and not yours. Like we're in a close relationship. Like, can you be here a little bit more with me? And that is true. Like, that is what I want to do, right?
Starting point is 01:36:29
And sometimes it can be a little distancing, right? And a little separate. People on the other end of that spectrum, if they know I'm very porous, I tend to, to me, one of the ways of also thinking about it, I think I gaze in before I gaze out. And I think a lot of people gaze out before they gaze in. They spend a lot of time in other people's brains
Starting point is 01:36:50
and less time in their own. What do they think of me? What do they think? If that's what's going on for you, then the shell to your egg isn't always intact. And so there's a spillover. Whose feelings are whose? Whose thoughts are whose?
Starting point is 01:37:08
I'm spending so much time worried about what that person thinks of me. I almost like, what am I, what do I, what do I think? And so the exercise you're naming is actually just a resetting of a boundary. And things that are absurdly concrete are necessary for the most primal parts of our brain to actually understand. My name is Becky Kennedy. To me what I say, I don't usually say that, I'll say, my feet are on the ground. When I do a grounding exercise, everyone in our community knows this, my hand is always
Starting point is 01:37:42
on my heart. I think there's some amount of having contact with your body, my hand is on my heart. Sometimes I used to do this with clients, especially after an emotional experience, going like this, name five things in the room is probably another way. There's a red clock, I'm wearing a white shirt. They're very, very, very basic as a way of kind of coming back into your body. Two mantras that I find help parents a lot actually make me think about this exercise. One is I am the pilot, not the turbulence.
Starting point is 01:38:17
In our kids' turbulent moments, when they are that turbulence, what so easily happens is we merge into that with them. And then it's no wonder our kids can't calm down or episodes last forever because we're just turbulence and turbulence together, right? So I'm the pilot, not the turbulence. Also one day I'm going to do a partnership with some airplane company because I feel like airplanes are just so beautiful because the pilot gets a cockpit.
Starting point is 01:38:46
They get a boundary. Like, it's, right? That's what parents need. So that's one. And the other one, when your kids are upset or after there's an argument, some people get very dysregulated just knowing someone's upset with them, right? Which is again, kind of whose feelings are whose. I find one of the most effective mantras, and again, these sound cheesy, is just,
Starting point is 01:39:05
I'm safe. This isn't an emergency. I can cope with this. Because our body, if you tend to be porous, you get activated just by other people being activated, even though it wasn't your feeling in the first place. And your body actually needs the reminder that you're safe to not kind of add to that turbulence.
Starting point is 01:39:28
I love it. Can we talk about projection for a second? Sure. One of the things that drives me insane, people close to me know this, because of this issue of porousness versus non-porousness is when people tell me how I feel. And so I've talked to a few very qualified psychiatrists
Starting point is 01:39:49
about this and it's called projection. Like sometimes if in anger, it's evacuate of projection. Like you think I'm crazy. Someone will say, like, you think I'm crazy or you're upset with me or something like that. I feel like projection is one of the kind of litmus tests of how porous we are. Because in theory, somebody should be able to tell us
Starting point is 01:40:11
that we feel whatever. And if we first look inside, and by the way, I love this concept of, do you first look inside or outside? Do you listen to what's inside or outside first when something kind of arises emotionally outside you. Love, love, love that. It's something I'll have to explore.
Starting point is 01:40:32
But if we don't do that, then you could see how projection would be very effective. And I'm not accusing anyone of using this in any kind of diabolical way. I think people just do it because it worked and they're doing it because they've always done it. But if somebody says, you know, like, like you don't care about me as a friend or, you know,
Starting point is 01:40:49
telling someone how they feel is so very different than telling someone how we feel, duh. All right, it's kind of obvious. And yet once you start watching for projection, you see it all the time. Yeah. Not just at you, but like in between people. Right.
Starting point is 01:41:04
Like, you know, like I know this stresses you out, but you know, people start doing it all the time. Yeah. Not just at you, but like in between people. Right. Like, you know, like I know this stresses you out, but you know, people start doing it all the time. And it's very interesting to see how people kind of divide into a couple of different groups on this, maybe two or more groups in terms of whether or not it affects them, and if it gets in their head, or somehow they're like, no, no, it's ridiculous.
Starting point is 01:41:20
I don't feel that way. And for me, it's very context specific, but I love your thoughts on projection both towards kids and from kids. So, all right, I'm gonna respond to that and you just cut me off, you're like, Becky, that's not the direction I want you to go in. Because I guess MGI, which is I call
Starting point is 01:41:41
most generous interpretation, is to me the embodiment of not what I do all the time. Definitely not, because I'm imperfect. But what I think is just a useful framework to try to employ as much as possible. Because the idea of what is the most generous interpretation of someone's behavior, like projection, counteracts our very natural human tendency, which is just what is the least generous interpretation. We all come up with the least generous interpretation
Starting point is 01:42:07
of people's behavior all the time, and it's just quick, it's easy. And I think it's because in our brain, if we see something bad or annoying, it's just easy to think that that's the whole, right? So I can't even tell you how many times every parent I know will say, my kid doesn't listen. They hit all the elevator buttons.
Starting point is 01:42:22
They hit other people. And then I said, and I know what you're thinking, they're a sociopath. They're like, that's literally what I'm thinking. I was like, I know, I have doesn't listen. They hit all the elevator buttons. They hit other people. And then I said, and I know what you're thinking, they're a sociopath. They're like, that's literally what I'm thinking. I was like, I know, I have that thought too. You know, when I was a kid, I used to push every button in the elevator. Right.
Starting point is 01:42:33
Does that mean I'm a sociopath? No, it means you are a good kid who has not yet learned the skills to regulate urges. That's all it means. That would be the most generous interpretation. They're there, you just wanna, no, I'm kidding. You just wanna push them. I'm joking. You just want to push him. I'm joking. I have a kid like that too.
Starting point is 01:42:47
He wants things for himself and he derives a lot of joy from things. Those types of kids are going to do things. Okay, that's my resilient rebel. Um, okay, but projection. Why am I bringing that up? So what's my most generous interpretation of why this projection would happen?
Starting point is 01:43:04
Why would a kid say, you're mad at me? Or, you know, I can see how mad you are So what's my most generous interpretation of why this projection would happen? Why would a kid say, you're mad at me? Or, you know, I can see how mad you are at me. Or why would someone even say in adulthood, you seem really, really stressed out, right? Again, the gazing in versus gazing out, I think it comes back to in our childhoods. I mean, that's what often a lot comes back to.
Starting point is 01:43:27
back to in our childhoods, I mean, that's what often a lot comes back to, were we taught that we have an emotional life that lives inside of us, then were we taught how to understand that emotional life, then were we taught how to manage and cope with that whole emotional life? Most people were not. So it becomes this very, very complicated conundrum. The emotional life is happening inside me again. Like you can't beat it. It's happening. Our feelings, you can't get rid of them. And they're very powerful. They're sensations. But if your framework was always you're getting punished, you're getting ridiculed, you're being
Starting point is 01:43:59
a baby, then you develop a very conflictual relationship with your feelings. Like they can't be real. They almost can't be mine. That's really what they can't be mine. People like this often blame other people a lot for things they never did when they're really frustrated and upset. Cause it's almost like this can't be mine. So like, who did this feeling to me?
Starting point is 01:44:23
You know, there's a lot of that in the world. A lot of that in the world. Who did this feeling to me? You know, there's a lot of that in the world. A lot of that in the world. Who did this feeling to me? Who put this in me, right? It's so fragile and so sad almost, and so, you know, toxic. But projection in a way is the only way that I can understand my emotional life,
Starting point is 01:44:46
is by imagining you having an emotional life. I don't know, like a lot of these things, I hear myself say this, I like, Mel, I was like, oh, what a vulnerable way to go about the world, what an awful way to live in your body, that you're so overwhelmed, way to live in your body, that you're so overwhelmed and almost so self abandoning of the information in your body that it must be someone else's. So that's what projection is.
Starting point is 01:45:20
So what do we do when we see it? I don't know, what's an example? Like, you're so stressed out. You've been so stressed and you're thinking, maybe you're thinking a partnership. Like, I feel like you're the one who's stressed, right? Never helps in the heat of the moment to be right. I've tried it a million times. I don't know about you. To be right in an argument?
Starting point is 01:45:40
To be right in a heated moment when you're like, I'm gonna be right. Not if you want an effective outcome, no. No, but it's a very hard urge to resist. It took me many years to learn, but someone taught it to me in one hour. I feel very grateful that she taught me this. She didn't tell me to do it,
Starting point is 01:45:58
but I just realized if you just like, I don't have any word other than just like soften. If you just, like, I don't have any word other than just, like, soften. If you just kind of, like, imagine becoming more like a noodle than like a rigid bar of iron. I just like, oh, and I actually, I think of the way that like my, he always comes up, but my, I had this bulldog mastiff, Costello, and he was like super lazy. The contract with him was he would protect me with his entire life, but if my life wasn't on the line,
Starting point is 01:46:29
noodle. And I remember just thinking like, if I just go there, then the basic contract of like, I care about you, I'll protect you with my life is still there. So I guess I learned it from my bulldog, but it sort of played out in a romantic relationship. And it was just really beautiful. It was one of the best things I learned from the two of them.
Starting point is 01:46:50
Is how I just like, literally like physically soften, then like everything becomes apparent. Somehow for me, it allows me to get back into my own eggshell, but still have optics out. Now that's me, I realize it's, and that doesn't mean in the heat of the moment I'm not like feeling like I wanna be reactive. But for me, a physical change to my body,
Starting point is 01:47:11
self-directed physical change to my body is what just kind of like changed everything. Yeah, and I think, you know, this is so true in relationships, definitely at work and definitely in parenting, is you don't have to represent everything you believe in like a given moment. Like we're not so fragile, like to be like, no, and you're projecting, like I have time,
Starting point is 01:47:34
like this is a heated moment. I can kind of chill out. You're so stressed. And I think I'm not. I think there's projection. I'm like, oh, I am? Who cares? Just like get through the moment. Right. And then maybe after, if it feels important. I'm not, I think there's projection. I'm gonna say like, oh, I am? Who cares? Just like get through the moment, right?
Starting point is 01:47:47
And then maybe after, if it feels important, I say, I feel like this thing happens sometimes where when you're stressed, you say I'm stressed. I don't know, like, let's talk about this. That's when that happens. I think this is really true with kids too, right? This happened the other day. And in some ways it's the same strategy,
Starting point is 01:48:05
which I jokingly on Instagram called do nothing with a capital D and a capital N, because so many times in hard situations, especially when you're accused of something, that's not true, people will say to parents, oh, so you're just gonna do nothing. Well, I'm like, take away the just. Like doing nothing in a heated moment
Starting point is 01:48:24
is a very sophisticated technique. Because really what you're saying is you're doing nothing on the outside and you're being an adult and managing your feelings on the inside. Amen to that. Versus doing nothing on the inside and just yelling or reacting on the outside.
Starting point is 01:48:41
So the other day my son came to me before school my youngest and he goes, my sweatshirt's still dirty. And I was like, oh man. He goes, you promised me you would wash my sweatshirt before school. Between us. He never asked me that. Okay? And here's my fork in the road. It's like, we all know what it would be easier. And what I, by the way, I wanted to say back to him, 99% of me was about to go, you never asked me. And then he'd say, I did.
Starting point is 01:49:11
No, you didn't. And now you're lying to me. And all of a sudden it's like, okay, you know what he was saying to me? I wish my sweatshirt was clean. That's what he was saying. That's what we're all saying. And I'm so upset about it.
Starting point is 01:49:25
The feeling is so big that it's, like, too overwhelming in this moment as a seven-year-old to be mine. So, like, I kind of have to make it your fault to try to make sense of it. So what did I do in the moment? I literally did nothing. You promised me you'd watch my sweatshirt. And I went like this.
Starting point is 01:49:47
I kind of was just looking at him like I knew what it was like to want something and not be able to have it. And he's like, you did. In the moment, I go, I did. That sweatshirt is dirty. You really wanted it to be clean. He's like, I really did.
Starting point is 01:50:06
I was like, oh, that's the worst. Not joking. And then he, by the end, by five minutes later, I didn't say anything. He got another sweatshirt. We moved on. I didn't say, I wasn't gonna like ruin the moment by being like, see, you could cope or you never asked me.
Starting point is 01:50:21
But I think in both these moments, whether someone's saying you're stressed or my kid's accusing me, if I think in both these moments, whether someone's saying you're stressed or my kid's accusing me, if I think about this a lot in parenting, I don't have to prove my parenting in a moment. I don't have to prove it to my kid. I don't have to prove it because my mother-in-law is watching. Like, I trust myself way more than I trust one single moment to represent everything about me. And I think when we can gain a little bit of that confidence, we have a lot more freedom to just be effective and to also know there's a moment to do nothing.
Starting point is 01:50:53
And then if something's a chronic issue, if my son's chronically blaming me, when things are less heated, I'm gonna say to him, you know, something and, you know, a calm moment. These are super important and novel approaches to things that I think everybody deals with, kids in the picture or not. My audience sometimes gets angry with me
Starting point is 01:51:16
when I ask very long extended questions, but could I just share with you something I learned about an experiment? Because I think it blew my mind. I won't take long. Could I just share with you something I learned about an experiment? Because I think it blew my mind. I won't take long. There's a imaging experiment. So you put people in a scanner, they image their brain, see which areas are active, fMRI.
Starting point is 01:51:38
There's a really wild experiment where they bring people in for the scan. They don't tell them why they're there. And they tell them they're going to be paid $30. And they set out in for the scan. They don't tell them why they're there. And they tell them they're gonna be paid $30 and they set out three $10 bills. Maybe you know this experiment, I don't know. Then they go into the scanner and then they come out and then the researcher leaves and there's a discussion, et cetera, et cetera.
Starting point is 01:51:56
And at some point, one of the $10 bills is removed by the researcher. And people are told at the end of the experiment, you took one of the $10 bills. And they're like, no, I didn't, because they didn't. Nobody says you're right. But then they re-image them, and they compare that to a condition in other subjects where people actually did a little sneaky steal during a money game.
Starting point is 01:52:26
And the same areas of the brain light up that we think are associated with guilt. In other words, if somebody is told that they did something, even if they know they didn't, there are aspects of brain circuitry that reflect a quote unquote feeling of guilt. It's like it introduces this question about reality. And so they can know with 100% certainty, you can know with 100% certainty that you did not do something. And yet it starts to introduce these questions about how you gauge reality.
Starting point is 01:52:57
Simply because somebody you just met a few minutes earlier, yes, in a position of authority, they're the researcher, you're the subject, et cetera, told you that you did it. I think this has huge implications for parent-child relationships, for romantic relationships, workplace relationships, for real bias in the outside world. You can imagine if you're told your whole life that like you're a piece of garbage
Starting point is 01:53:18
or that you're part of a bad group or something like this, like I'm not trying to get political here. Like you could come to believe that at a level that is biological, even if cognitively doesn't make sense. So, this is where I think about this like challenging boundary between knowing what we know, being a container, staying in our frame, you know, pick your favorite lingo around this.
Starting point is 01:53:41
And the fact that words and the emotions of other people really do have the capacity to rewire us on the inside. You know, a question I'd have about that study, I'd be really curious if there was variation among subjects where some people, that guilt part lit up a lot more. Okay, so you reminded me. So this is the wild part.
Starting point is 01:54:03
Okay. The distribution of kind of like people who have this, by the way, folks, there aren't single brain areas for whole emotions, but let's just for sake of simplicity here, that have the guilt area activated, even when they didn't take the money. The entire population of subjects
Starting point is 01:54:20
doesn't experience that to the same degree. You have these people for whom it's very high amplitude response and others who aren't. Now, I don't recall, and I need to go back and look at the study if it divided according to male female, because earlier you said that this tendency... I would bet a million dollars that if I got to know
Starting point is 01:54:36
those people, the people who really light up, have a lot of focus on gazing out and determining their inner reality by what other people think about them. And the people who did not light up as much are the people who gaze in and have a deep sense of themselves, even in the face of kind of a lack of validation or even in the face of criticism. I would bet my money on that psychological kind of...
Starting point is 01:55:03
Is that a moderator or a mediator? I don't know what you would tell me. So I'd be very money on that psychological kind of, is that a moderator or a mediator? I don't know what you would tell me. So I'd be very curious about that. Great, well, I have no skin in the game. Like I didn't run this study and I'll go back and check it out. I mean, I think it's fascinating. It's a collection of studies and I hadn't known about this.
Starting point is 01:55:15
I mean, I read the neuroscience literature, but I hadn't known about this. I find it like a complete yes, of course, on the one hand, and also super surprising on the other, and just oh, so cool, in the sense that it's informative. And it's making me think that some people really need to do the work of paying more attention to other people's emotions
Starting point is 01:55:36
and feeling them a little bit more, and other people probably need to do the exact opposite. That's exactly right. And to me, like, I always, I say this to people I manage, I say, like, I think about this in general with adults. Like, I think such an empowering thing as an adult is just to know where you are in any given scale. So for me, as a leader, I'm always gas.
Starting point is 01:55:58
I'm like, go, go, go, we can do this, we can get this accomplished. I'm probably like pretty far in that. And given that, I know it's really important for me to have people around me who sometimes say like, whoa, let's look at this first, right? I also know that sometimes if I do have a like, maybe I should slow this down,
Starting point is 01:56:17
I should like really listen to that because that's like not right. But knowing where I am on a scale is important. I talk about someone that I manage who she really needs to be more direct with the people she manages. Just like, you know, like sometimes ask questions when she really wants statements and can have a little higher standard. And I think it's helpful to know where she is in that scale because I remember saying,
Starting point is 01:56:39
like, I want you to go as far as you can toward the other direction without being disrespectful because it's almost impossible to do that, right? And so I think for adults to know, let's say I gaze in or I more gaze out, neither is better or worse. Probably, again, mental health and resilience is about having just a lack of rigidity. And so to say, what is my starting point?
Starting point is 01:57:00
Like anyone listening, what is my starting point? There's no morality. It's literally not better or worse. It just gives me information about which direction to experiment with. And I like to make this a concrete experiment, right? So let's say you are someone who tends to gaze out before you gaze in. And you're always like, I can't do this thing I want to do because it would inconvenience someone. I told this story the other day on my Instagram and people went bananas about it. I was at the airport and I got a cup of coffee in the morning and I liked my coffee with
Starting point is 01:57:33
just like a really little bit of milk, right? And I know to specify it if I'm asking someone else. I went to the counter and I said, hey, can I get a medium coffee, not black, just a little little bit of milk, pretty close to black? Sure, no problem. I go, I wait in line, then it's on the counter. I pick it up, Becky, and it's like light as can be. I got back online.
Starting point is 01:57:55
I brought the coffee. And I said, hey, I asked for this. I know there's a lot of people probably got lost. I asked for this, you know, darker. Could you pour out a good amount of this and then refill it with coffee? The person, you know, who knows if it could have gone differently.
Starting point is 01:58:09
Different, oh, right, no problem, here you go. This happens with things that are so much bigger than coffee, but the coffee example is such a good one, because what I'm doing in that moment is I'm saying, I'm allowed to have my coffee the way I wanted it and ask for it, even if it's awkward or inconveniences the other person. Now, can people be on the opposite extreme and can someone hear this and be like, I probably need to do a little bit less of my own needs. That's what I'm saying. You have to know you are. But what I have found at least with moms
Starting point is 01:58:47
is the idea of, oh, you know, I asked for almond milk and this is whole milk. Or I used to give my clients this experiment who had this struggle. I said, I want you at the grocery store. After you're basically done checking out, to say, oh, you know what? I actually don't need those paper towels.
Starting point is 01:59:08
I can't even tell you. People are like, I can't do that. I can't return it. Oh, my goodness. It was like a panic attack. And the panic, the panic feeling is, that would be a completely new circuit. That would be me saying, I'm willing to do something
Starting point is 01:59:24
to meet my own needs. I actually don't need that paper towel. Even though it could get an eye roll or inconvenience temporarily someone else. Those little experiments, and it might be the opposite. It might be saying to my partner tonight, you know what, we always sit down and talk about my work. And I actually did have a stressful day, but you know what? I want to hear about your day.
Starting point is 01:59:49
You go first. That's also an experiment. And for someone who's on that extreme, they're going to also have a panic attack. They're going to be like, this is deeply uncomfortable. But just knowing where you are in the spectrum gives you the information you need to get a little bit of balance. Yeah. I think there's clearly a distribution
Starting point is 02:00:05
and whether or not it's a binary distribution or it's kind of like a normal distribution, I don't know, but there's clearly variants here from one person to the next. And probably even depending on how well rested we are and all the rest, but I do think that we do kind of fall into phenotypes of prone to reacting to other people's emotions without hearing
Starting point is 02:00:27
and listening to and responding to hours first, like truly hours first versus people who are just really out there. I realized it's very different than any other kind of relationship, but when I first went from being a post-doc to having my own laboratory, the chair in my department, my chairman in one department anyway, he said, you know, you should get a great big desk that's like really thick. I was like, yeah, like why? I mean, I get it.
Starting point is 02:00:50
You don't want to be sitting like right next to your employees or something, but like why so that? And he goes, so that when they cry, you won't feel like you need to cry or take care of them. You'll just slide the Kleenex across the desk. And I was like, are you kidding? And he was like, no. And then years later, I looked back
Starting point is 02:01:10
and I realized I understood what he was saying. I mean, he didn't know me at all, but he was just saying probably something about himself, which is people are gonna come into your office, they're gonna cry, it does happen, and you're going to need to be the boss, which is to be supportive and empathic, but like you can't get pulled into it
Starting point is 02:01:27
because they might be crying about something they don't like about the lab or about something not happening the way they want it. I mean, who could imagine any other reason to cry in your boss's office, but maybe they have a family issue. And, you know, so you have to remember you're the boss. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. I ended up with a desk that was kind of medium in width.
Starting point is 02:01:46
But I think that nowadays there's a lot more kind of bleeding of roles. And, you know, it used to be that everyone got really dressed up for work. Now dressing down is like common in certain circumstances and not others. I think that there's a lot of kind of lack of clarity about, here we go again, power and authority,
Starting point is 02:02:11
but also kind of staying in our own frame versus taking on someone else's frame. Yeah. You know, I have a friend who runs a pretty large business and he did the same experiment that you did of asking people how he could do better. But first he unfortunately made the mistake of asking people how he could do better. But first he unfortunately made the mistake of asking people how they felt about being there.
Starting point is 02:02:29
And they ended up making one of these emotion clouds where they took, everyone filled out a thing and wrote what the most dominant emotions were. And then he told this story like, call me late at night. He sits down and they're gonna present this as data in front of everybody. And this emotion cloud comes up and the biggest bubble in the middle just says, stress.
Starting point is 02:02:49
And he was mortified, right? But he learned that they all feel really, really, really stressed. That sort of exercise would never have happened 10, 15 years ago. It's like, yeah, like I won't say what profession he's in for sake of privacy, but like it's a profession where stress is part of the process
Starting point is 02:03:08
and you don't kind of get the certificate at the end, so to speak, if you don't experience stress. But this actually relates to what we started with in a way. I'm gonna circle it back there, which is, and cause I hear this a lot, you know, kind of some kids these days, they don't know how to tolerate stress or they're always overwhelmed.
Starting point is 02:03:28
But part of it is, again, maybe this is my MGI, maybe they haven't been told the right story about stress or anxiety. This came up with my kids the other day. My older son had his first basketball game of the season and he goes, oh, I'm really nervous, feeling a little anxious. And it's just so interesting, like the way we respond in little ways to our kids in these moments form like
Starting point is 02:03:50
the way they end up thinking about those feelings later on. I said, well, of course you're nervous. Being nervous means you care. You really care about basketball. Right? And obviously we've had many conversations about what feelings mean, but it was so interesting. I watched him go, yeah, I do care. Kind of in that little sentence, being nervous means you care. I mean, think about it, you're never nervous about anything you don't care about. Right?
Starting point is 02:04:15
If being nervous means I care, I have a story to understand it. I now inherently feel like the feeling is normal. I'm almost like proud, you know? Like, yeah, I do care, right? My relationship with that feeling is going to be so different than if my parents are like, why are you nervous? There's nothing to be nervous about.
Starting point is 02:04:34
Or, oh, you're nervous? Oh, does that mean you're not gonna play well? Oh my goodness, are you gonna miss your foul shots? I mean, so in the first, right, my kid feels like being nervous is wrong. So I just set them up to feel like they're feeling the wrong feeling when they're feeling nervous going on. In the second, I'm laying on my anxiety to their nervousness.
Starting point is 02:04:51
Not a great combo. But the stories we tell matter. So in the workplace, you're stressed. Yeah, you know, action just makes me think, maybe not right now, one day more time. It would be really helpful to talk about what is stress? Why do we feel stress? How do we talk to talk about what is stress? Why do we feel stress? How do we talk to ourselves when we feel stress?
Starting point is 02:05:08
Does anyone here know the way you talk to yourself when you're stressed has the power to make stress feel a little smaller or a little bigger? That's really interesting. I wonder, does anyone here use a session? Should we do something in the workplace about how to deal with stress? Because you're right. This is a stressful job. And this is where I don't think about power, but authority. And I wanna own that and let you know that
Starting point is 02:05:34
stress comes along with this type of job. I'm making this up. And this is why you get paid pretty well. And this is why, you know, whatever else could be true. But one of my jobs is not just being honest, but actually helping everyone develop the best skills that maybe no one ever taught them before to manage stress. Let me know if that's of interest. I just think about the whole mood just changed. You kind of own your authority and you own the story. And I think whether you're
Starting point is 02:06:00
talking about being a CEO or being a parent, it's actually all the same. That makes sense. I have a rule, which is if my pulse rate goes above a certain limit, my thumbs stop working, meaning I won't allow myself to text. I don't talk on the phone. I'll just go in the bathroom and just sit for a second if I have to, but that's rare.
Starting point is 02:06:20
Typically, I just am like, I have a rule. If my heart rate goes up, my thumbs don't work. What do you do? I just do nothing. I follow the do nothing Typically, I just am like, I have a rule, my heart rate goes up, my thumbs don't work. What do you do? I just do nothing. I follow the do nothing thing. I just wait. I mean, I also have a rule, which is unless somebody's hemorrhaging
Starting point is 02:06:31
right in front of me, it usually can wait. Drives people crazy, but they thank me later. Like unless somebody's literally hemorrhaging, like I can pause my response. Because I'm a kind of like move fast, get things done kind of person. And actually it was taught to me by a chairman of a major university in New York home city
Starting point is 02:06:53
of New York city. He said, there's always more time. And I said, that's ridiculous. He said, unless somebody is hemorrhaging right in front of you, there's always more time. Going back to my daughter, it's one of the mantras that's been really helpful for me as someone who, again, just knowing myself, I always like to go, go, go. I get so much pleasure, probably identity,
Starting point is 02:07:12
value from doing things. And so a byproduct of that is I always kind of feel like I'm in a rush because my body craves movement and checking things off. But being in a rush is never terribly helpful in close relationships. No one likes to feel like, come on, can you get to the end of the story?
Starting point is 02:07:29
Or, you know, that's not good. So sometimes I think efficiency in relationship building are like antithetical. I, amen, a thousand times over. You know, I don't think we can be efficient in relationships. It's like efficiency in other things is beautiful. Well, it's a unitary experience being efficient
Starting point is 02:07:50
in relation, and so like when I can be in efficiency a lot, mode a lot, and it's something that I have to really think when I'm going home to my closest relationships, and it's interesting, now that I work so much more than I used to, it's almost reinforcing the efficiency mode, so I really know I have to, you know, my own therapy, like really work on, like, that's not a value of mine all the time at work.
Starting point is 02:08:11
Maybe sometimes even there, sometimes you got to get out of it to connect to people. Right. And so that is something again, where like knowing where I am on that scale, asking people to call me out. Oh, mom, you're rushing me at night. Becky, I wanna tell you the whole story. I'm not just trying to give you the TLDR. I want the experience of telling you the story. I'm like, right, I'm doing that thing.
Starting point is 02:08:36
Yeah, slowing down is rarely a mistake. I guess occasionally, but rarely a mistake. Really true. I'd like to talk a little bit about technology. I know this is a growing interest of yours. I've been thinking a little bit based on our earlier discussion about sort of people who were in their own container
Starting point is 02:08:55
or sensing what's going on inside them prior to paying attention to and sensing what's going on in other people, because clearly both are important. I don't like this idea that it's like one or the other. But with the advent of text messaging, so here I'm not gonna talk about social media, this is not about social media.
Starting point is 02:09:14
With text messaging, first of all, this is the first time in human evolution that humans have written with their thumbs. That's weird, been kind of quirky reflection. But the other one is this is the first time in human evolution, meaning very recently that we are aware of what's going on with so many other people and we're expected
Starting point is 02:09:33
to at least know it and perhaps even respond to it. I mean, it's just, I know people younger than 30 are probably gonna wait. No, it's always been this way, but it wasn't always this way. Clearly our brain has adapted to this new format, but it did not evolve in this format, whereby you're getting on a plane and you look at your phone and you are aware of the movements and requests
Starting point is 02:09:54
and maybe kind statements, et cetera, from other people. We're tethered in so many ways. And that means that our brain is really tethered to the states of others, their emotional states, their physical states, where they are. You said, and I'll keep repeating it because I love it so much,
Starting point is 02:10:10
the more you can locate somebody, the more it reflects their values. So being able to locate somebody in space and time and understand how bounded they are or not to their own emotions or you're as fantastic. But the fact that you have 10 people in your phone that you're aware of, you're not even supposed to be aware of 10 people at once,
Starting point is 02:10:29
except the 10 people perhaps around you on the boarding a plane. Yeah. So we're being forced to navigate a new landscape with all this. Yes. After this conversation folds, we'll look at our phones. You couldn't have that many, I guarantee one thing,
Starting point is 02:10:45
no matter how many text messages or few text messages you have, it's far more conversations, if you will, than you could possibly have by phone at once. Yep. So in the old days, you left messages and you'd get on the phone when you could. Not saying we go back to that,
Starting point is 02:11:01
but I think we might be asking ourselves to do something that is impossibly hard and maybe even bad for us. Yeah, I don't know how apocalyptic you want me to get about this, but I think I actually, my husband and I were talking about phones and text and social media and AI.
Starting point is 02:11:25
And I brought up something to him. He's like, I don't think I've, and all the arguments I've heard, I haven't heard that. Where I feel like we're changing in a dramatic way our basic evolutionary drive around attachment. In a way where attachment has always been the primary evolutionary drive of humans. And with all the different technological shifts there have been, because people say, oh, there's been this, there's been this. What's never been shifted is kind of the nature really of one-to-one human attachment. We're entering into something really new, where let's even say text messages, 20 at
Starting point is 02:12:06
once, 10 at once. Our bodies will always crave what's immediately gratifying over what is long-term good for us. It's just, it's, and another way I think about it is our bodies will always choose convenience and ease and gratification over what's good for us long-term. So you think about all these pings coming in. It's a lot of information, this text, that text, this text, this text. And what you're doing in your circuitry and over time evolutionarily is getting used to
Starting point is 02:12:34
the multiplicity of relationships, the multiplicity of information. It's just more gratifying than one-on-one. To the point that one-on-one conversation over text or even in person is going to have so much more of a gap than it ever has been in terms of how slow, how low-stim, and how boring and awkward it is compared to, especially for kids who get this early, the constant information flow and gratification and stimulation. I think that's gonna have a profound impact, not right away, but over time,
Starting point is 02:13:11
and if you add in social media and then if you add in AI. I mean, on the way humans just are even able to relate to each other. So, yes, I think, like, this advancement in technology and what's happening, I think there's always been a trade-off, always, between how short-term gratifying something is and how long-term good something is for us. Because the things that are really good for humans long-term are the things that
Starting point is 02:13:38
involve humans to tolerate frustration. I would say that is the most important skill I think for kids to learn. But the world more than ever is built now with insanely low frustration tolerance because we're built for so much information, so much consumption, and so much immediate gratification. This is actually, I think, the thing that isn't talked about with technology. It's why parenting has changed. It's why so much of parenting is about making kids happy in their lives easy because there's never been a generation of parents like my generation, where our lives are just so much easier. We have so much less tolerance for our kids' tantrums, because we're on our phones wanting
Starting point is 02:14:15
our life to be easier. So we stop the tantrum. We make their life easier. We make them anxious. We make them fragile because of our lowered frustration tolerance. So I don't know where we're landing here, but, and by the way, I text. I'm not like a purist here. I'm a realist.
Starting point is 02:14:30
I live in the world. But I think it's profound how it's changing human interaction and expectations and gratification. My colleague Anna Lemke, who wrote Dopamine Nation, cited some data that humans have more free time now across socioeconomic groups, more free time for everybody than ever before, more expectation of immediate gratification. And it's not just the texts that we're getting, it's for some people the texts that they're not getting, they're thinking about the people that they haven't heard back from, et cetera. I mean, the number of tethers, right, exactly.
Starting point is 02:15:08
Like the number of tethers is just astonishing. I had a conversation with somebody recently that popped to mind where it was a little bit, it was like a low friction one. That ended in a really good place where I said, you know, the problem is, you know, I was talking about, there's a little bit of an age gap. And I said, you know, the problem is you think slow is low.
Starting point is 02:15:31
Like what I was saying was I like to just chill. This is something I haven't done enough of in my life because I'm pretty ambitious person and always have been since I was little about everything. But I've learned that like, slow isn't low. I had love just like sitting down and like hanging out with the dog or just like slowing down.
Starting point is 02:15:53
And it used to feel like slow was low. It used to feel like, oh, nothing's happening or this is depressing or it's boring. And I think in recent years, that became more and more the case as I got more and more pulled into technology And then I did a little bit of a technology distancing experiment if you will have this wooden box that someone made for me and I put my phones in there and
Starting point is 02:16:13
It's so amazing how once you put the phone in a different container It like completely changes the relationship to it I don't get it. But anyway again physical barriers to make to take emotional steps always a good idea and but anyway, again, physical barriers to take emotional steps, always a good idea. And I just realized like slow isn't low, like slow is awesome. So I totally agree that the circuits of our brain have now adapted to expect immediate gratification. I like to think, and maybe this is a false wish,
Starting point is 02:16:41
but I like to think that there are components of our brain that are hardwired enough through tens or hundreds of thousands of years of evolution that might be able to recognize and appreciate the slow moments and not feel like slow is low, meaning slow is depressing. But I do think that if one is weaned in, raised in an environment where you expect things quickly, well then, you know, it's going to feel like the horse and cart compared to the car at some level. I do, I agree. I think that's right.
Starting point is 02:17:13
And I think for parents who have young kids, I think these are such powerful and empowering things to think about when your kids are young because I think it's easy to think, oh, okay, so I'll deal with this when my kid gets a phone. It's the circuits around even how your kid will use the phone, how much you're going to be able to set boundaries with your kid when they get a phone. All of these have to do with the patterns early on. So if we go back to slow is good, frustration and frustration tolerance is the name of the game. It requires a lot of
Starting point is 02:17:47
inconvenient moments that matter so much for how not only your kid learns to tolerate the frustration inherent in life, but I think this is really important, how your kid learns to feel capable. Kids only develop capability from watching themselves get through hard things. They don't develop capability by being successful, ever. In some ways, it builds up this pressure and a fragility if that's been the only thing they have. And when we think about this whole generation
Starting point is 02:18:17
who's so anxious, kind of so fragile, I really believe the antidote to anxiety is capability. And we, and I'll give you an example, like we steal our kids capability all the time when they're young in the name of short-term convenience for everyone. So here's an example. Like Mike, I remember this day, my oldest who's now 13,
Starting point is 02:18:37
was like three and he was really into puzzles when he was three. Puzzles are like really hard, right? He was working on it, something like, I can't do it, you know, the classic wine, which I just want everyone to know, like no part of me is like, I love that sound. No, like nobody likes whining, okay? But to me, those are our like bang for our buck moments. You know, they're not our easy moments, they're our bang for our buck.
Starting point is 02:19:03
My kid is going to learn something about how to deal with situations they don't think they're capable of completing. That is such an important lesson. And I have a fork in the road. I can either do the puzzle for him, which gives me short-term convenience, stops the meltdown. But beyond frustration tolerance, like one of the things I really remember thinking when my kid was young is if I do it for him, I'm stealing his capability.
Starting point is 02:19:34
Because if he can get through this and kind of get to the point where he says, I did a puzzle I didn't think I could do, that's incredible. So I remember this because it felt so, he's still whined, but there are these moments as a parent, and this is what I like to help parents with. Our wins are not based on our kids' reactions. Our wins happen when you just know there's this amazing feeling you have as a parent.
Starting point is 02:19:58
I know that was important. I know it. And I remember saying to him with this puzzle situation, sweetie, I'm not gonna do the puzzle for you. And I remember saying to him with this puzzle situation, sweetie, I'm not going to do the puzzle for you. And I want to tell you why. The feeling you get when you think you can't do something, kind of take a deep breath, maybe take a break, maybe even the next day, watch yourself do that thing is literally
Starting point is 02:20:23
the best feeling in the world. It is the best feeling it becomes addictive and I will not take that feeling away from you Because I believe you're gonna get it. I could cry like and one of the things I Feel people hear the story like violent. Okay, Becky great, you know, I do not do that all the time Sometimes I finish the puzzle but when we think about what we want for our kids later in life, it might be, no, I'm not getting you a phone yet. How a kid reacts to that situation is not just about a phone. It's kind of, well, have you always just done the thing for me? Have you always just given me what I want?
Starting point is 02:20:59
Do I have any ability to feel like I can tolerate frustration and wait and figure things out. That all layers into how kids react to not getting a phone, how kids approach hard math problems, how kids do or do not sit down to start their English essay. That is difficult to do. And all that stuff, you can start building those skills in the teenage years, don't get me wrong. But the leg up your kid has at 14, when they've been basically building those life
Starting point is 02:21:28
and academic skills from the start, and they've built their identity around capability, like that's what I wanna give every parent and every kid in the world. Yeah, it's awesome. I said it last time we spoke, I'll say it again, if you're thinking of adopting, I'd be happy to
Starting point is 02:21:45
Put myself up for adoption. It's such a beautiful Philosophy and stance to take around effort and frustration. I mean again, this isn't about my life But I feel so blessed that came up in science where things take forever You can work two years on a project and then discover you do the right control experiment, you know, like we got nothing They literally we have nothing. Yeah. And there still isn't a tendency to publish what are called negative results,
Starting point is 02:22:11
which aren't bad results, but where you basically got nothing. You can find a flaw in the reagents you're using, you get nothing, you're starting again. Yep. And to have that, you know, a few times and to have some papers take two, three, four years to get accepted, other papers six months.
Starting point is 02:22:25
I'll tell you, the six months feels really short. But these days we get so much immediate gratification. Yes. The other day I was staying at a hotel and I ordered food in. I don't do it that often. I was like, I really want like a poke bowl. There's that poke bowl place.
Starting point is 02:22:41
I ordered, it was there in 11 minutes. I was like, whoa, like, this is so wild. I was like, I gotta be careful. Not cause I'll overeat poke bowls. You can only have so many poke bowls, but it's like, you just, it's there. Convenience. Yeah.
Starting point is 02:22:55
It's so, you know. It's incredible. I remember. And sad and scary and exciting and all the things, you know? So I think having variable durations of effort reward in one's life. And being able to see where like the latency is very short, yes, social media, but you know, other things that where you have longer duration effort
Starting point is 02:23:15
to reward contingencies, I'm sounding kind of, this is like nerd speak, but I've gone on record saying before, and I'll say again that, you know, dopamine that is achieved without effort preceding it is just be really careful. Doesn't matter if it's amphetamine, cocaine, social media, or anything else.
Starting point is 02:23:34
You get used to the schedule. That's right. And I think we need to be able to tolerate and enjoy and lean into and savor variable schedules of effort and reward. It's so interesting you say that. I have two thoughts that, number one, when I think about the puzzle situation,
Starting point is 02:23:49
that's like effort, because effort, effort, effort, struggle, deep breath, effort, effort, nope, that's not it, effort, effort, and then you get the dopamine. That circuit, I just always think, that is such a benefit to my kid later in life. It's kind of the opposite of, you know, which we all do sometimes, but if it's the only circuit,
Starting point is 02:24:10
being on your iPad all the time as a little kid and the no effort, all the dopamine. Well, I think about it as a friend used to call it years ago, birthday money. There's one time each year, okay, maybe a couple because of the holidays, when you're supposed to get presents just for being you, it's called your birthday, right?
Starting point is 02:24:27
Or if you're a kid, you know, or whatever holidays are where we celebrate kids by giving presents or we celebrate each other. But every other day, you're not supposed to get rewards necessarily just because, not just for being you. The rewards are out there in life and appreciating things. I'm not trying to be too stoic here,
Starting point is 02:24:42
but there's only one day each year where you get literally presents just for being you. The other stuff is supposed to require effort. Yeah, and struggle. I think, you know, it's really interesting. My second had a lot of speech issues and she was younger. And I kind of noticed it. Like at a certain age,
Starting point is 02:24:58
you're supposed to be building sounds and words and she was replacing. Like as soon as she had a new sound, she lost one and had a sense of what was going on. She had a pretty serious speech apraxia. She had to go to speech therapy three days a week, right, for probably a year. She now, you wouldn't know.
Starting point is 02:25:14
But it was interesting, I remember that time, my older one, I'm sorry, five, maybe she was two or three and six. And I remember someone saying to me like, oh, about my daughter, like, oh, poor her, kind of, you know, it's like a lot. And I don't think I said this, oh, about my daughter, like, oh, poor her, kind of, you know, it's like a lot. And I don't think I said this, but it's so interesting. I remember thinking, she's way better off than my son.
Starting point is 02:25:32
If I'm gonna worry about one of my kids right now, which I'm not worried about either, I would worry about my son. His early years were so linear, so without struggle, like she's gonna have an early experience of struggling, working hard. She won't remember it with her words, but that circuitry, which are important memories,
Starting point is 02:25:53
ones we don't remember with our words, ones that our bodies remember, she has such an early experience with watching herself struggle and get to the other side. Like I would wish that for every child. And so I also think I want to also share that story because I think parents who have kids who have those early issues, it's so easy. Oh, I actually think it's really empowering to do a complete 180,
Starting point is 02:26:16
to be like, wait, I'm not going to fix this right away. I'm going to support my child. I'm going to let them know I believe in them. I'm going to let them know I see a version of them that's going to get through this. They're going gonna still struggle. And that is actually gonna be like the best foundation and almost like the best leg up. Yeah, I have a friend very, very successful who told me that he wasn't until, you know,
Starting point is 02:26:36
until he was in his 40s that he had like kind of a major, difficult life, a major business disappointment. And it almost crushed him. Like, you know, but he had never had that before. He had been so successful over and over again. You know, it was fun for me to talk to my dad recently on the podcast because we haven't had a conversation like that ever.
Starting point is 02:26:59
And we were talking about sort of mistakes that one makes and in the context of, you know, work and et cetera, and he said, and it's still ringing in my ears, he said, well, you know, those humiliations are actually good for us. He called them humiliations. I was like, really? He was like, yeah, you know, they humble us and they keep us thoughtful about what we're doing next.
Starting point is 02:27:18
And I was like, yeah, but it was kind of wild to hear that. I don't know why I need to hear it externally, because I know it's true. I knew it was true. But yeah, it's not just making mistakes. Like sometimes, listen, I'm fully against bullying where I understand how that can be very destructive, but like there are gonna be times when we're gonna feel humiliated.
Starting point is 02:27:36
And to be able to bounce back from that is pretty awesome. I actually think that builds character strength. I do. Yeah, and I think, you know, this is like a great lead into parenting. I actually think that builds character strength. I do. Yeah, and I think, you know, this is like a great lead into parenting. I hear this all the time where someone will say, I don't know if my kid's being bullied,
Starting point is 02:27:52
but like they're, you know, they were told, you can't play basketball with us. You're the worst basketball player in the grade, something like that, right? Where the way I work with parents, right, is again, assuming this isn't chronic, I don't think step one is calling the school. I don't think step one is calling the other parent, right?
Starting point is 02:28:11
If you zoom out, you're right. Like, I don't think a kid's gonna be called the worst basketball player, you know, over and over in the course of the next couple decades, but they will be called something. They'll be left out. Or even if nothing happens, you know what's gonna happen? They're gonna feel less than in a group. Like, probably a million times. I do, right? Still. So we have this almost opportunity of like, okay, well, what skills would be useful when
Starting point is 02:28:34
my kid is 18 and 30? And actually the struggle, again, is my opportunity. I was thinking, my kids are in my home for 18 years. I, it sounds like sick, and I don't know if I really mean this, but I'm going to say it, I almost hope they have all the variations of struggles they're going to have later on. Because then at least I can kind of get in it with them and like build some skills and help them see that they can manage. And then I feel like those bumps are going to happen, I guess it's like pilots, don't they? When they have simulations,
Starting point is 02:29:08
there's no way they simulate perfect flights and say you're ready to fly. They simulate all the issues so that a pilot can learn the right controls and then they're really prepared. They don't take away the issues. Right, no, I love the analogy of flying, because I'll never forget driving in the really thick fog
Starting point is 02:29:28
for the first time. This happens if you grow up in the Bay Area. Just being able to see one reflector at a time and being terrified. Now, like driving in fog never feels great, but I've been there. It's like it's a familiar feeling. And yeah, I've been thinking a lot these days
Starting point is 02:29:44
about this whole thing about proficiency and our expectation of kids nowadays, you know, that we have been told for a long time that we need to guard against kids feeling terrible about themselves. On the other hand, we want them to be proficient. And what you're really talking about here, if I understand correctly, is proficiency at being human,
Starting point is 02:30:04
at being really good at certain things, less good at others. I can also tell, you know, any kid, because I was this kid, like in a group of musicians, I'm the least proficient. I mean, you really just talk about wanting someone to do nothing. I'm best off not even playing the triangle.
Starting point is 02:30:18
Okay, like just doing nothing would be the best thing I could do to any musical effort. But I realized that at some point, even though every kid in my school played an instrument, they had like the youth symphony and all that kind of stuff, because it was also a time when I could just kind of relax. Like you don't have to be certainly best at everything, but I also believe that in order to really find
Starting point is 02:30:40
what you're kind of quote unquote meant for, you have to try a bunch of things and find out what you're never going to even approach partially skilled at. But you still have to try. I guess that's the point. So on the one hand, I guess I'm saying do nothing. On the other hand, I'm saying you still have to try.
Starting point is 02:30:54
I guess you have to try to find out that you're really as bad at music as I found out I am. Maybe, or I think we're also talking. I'm good with it. I'm good with it. I love music, but I don't need to play it. But I think then what you're saying is you're able to separate your identity from any behavior. Being bad at music doesn't mean you're a bad person.
Starting point is 02:31:10
And I think anyone hears that and they're like, obviously, but we conflate those two things 90% of the time, right? That's why we really care about winning at Scrabble is like to some degree we think it means we're smart and everyone's like, you know, versus, I'm probably the same level of smart whether I win at Scrabble or lose at Scrabble is like to some degree we think it means we're smart and everyone's like, you know, versus I'm probably the same level of smart whether I win at Scrabble or lose at Scrabble, right? And to me that's what confidence is. It's not feeling like you're the best at something.
Starting point is 02:31:34
It's feeling like it's okay to be you when you're not the best at something, right? It's feeling at home with yourself. And to me feeling at home with yourself is, first of all, it's an amazing internal motivator because you get to also figure out what you're really passionate about, right? And yeah, learning to participate in things and even have joy in things that you're not great at. Again, these are things I think our kids really can learn, not from lessons, not from a textbook, not really from a teacher.
Starting point is 02:32:03
They learn it from what we model. It's actually interesting. We play a ton of not really from a teacher. They learn it from what we model. It's actually interesting. We play a ton of board games, my family. And I'm just, I think they're like the antidote to everything on the screen. So we have a million board games. I'm the resident, if anyone ever needs a recommendation for a good board game.
Starting point is 02:32:15
What's your favorite board game to play as a family? Okay, I love Sushi Go. Okay, I don't know it, but I'll check it out. Sushi Go Party is the better version. It's actually a really great adult game too. It's very strategic. We play code names. We play a lot of board too. It's very strategic. We play code names. We play a lot of word games.
Starting point is 02:32:28
We play Boggle, we play Ghost, we play Scrabble, we play Rummy Q, but the game I was gonna say that we also play a lot of that I love is Scategories. Okay, so have you ever played that? Yeah, that's a fun game. I, whatever part of the brain is good at generating a lot of different things from a single letter must be very small in my brain.
Starting point is 02:32:47
I am so bad at scategories. I mean, my kids are all pretty quick. I lose to everyone, my seven-year-old included. I'm horrible. It actually is a game I suggest often. I'm like, let's play scategories. And I think that's actually so powerful for our kids. I mean, I think a lot of us, if we look back,
Starting point is 02:33:06
we think like, is one of the reasons my parents didn't really play with me or do things, they felt like they weren't good at it, you know? Like, probably, right? To demonstrate to your kid, I can choose something. I can have joy in something. I can want to do something that I'm not good at. That is, again, gonna be more powerful to your kid than
Starting point is 02:33:25
sitting down and saying, this is what we think is going to help kids. It's okay to do things that you're not good at. That's like logical words in the brain. That's not an experience they're building or internalizing. Kids learn from stories, from experiences. And so I think that's one way in terms of how do I help my kids be confident But also just be at home with themselves and do things are not best at Probably the best way to do that is to model it over and over to your kids. I love it back to Theory versus practice. Yes. I'm big on practice. Maybe I'm both I feel like as long as there are kids and adults that seem,
Starting point is 02:34:06
I want to emphasize seem, to do everything well, the athlete, academic, musician, good dancer, as long as charming with other people, as long as those people exist or seem to exist, we're going to have to all overcome our sense that we should be at least partially good at a wide variety of things, maybe not everything. Do you think those people exist?
Starting point is 02:34:35
No, I know they don't exist. I know that there are people that apparently are like that. They're fakers. Well, I don't know. I will say that, and this is, I don't get paid to say positive things about the university I work for or not, but I will say occasionally I'll meet a student
Starting point is 02:34:56
from Stanford and I'm like, goodness gracious. Like this kid, right, can apparently do everything. Like they're an athlete and they're a musician. They have all these things that they, there are those people. And I will say, but this is important, the pressure that the perception of those people creates on them without fail,
Starting point is 02:35:21
brings them to immense challenge in their life, if not then later. I've seen it every single time. I know because I grew up in the town where I'm now a professor. And I went to school with many people who ended up there or other places like that. And of course there are people like that in every environment.
Starting point is 02:35:39
They are outliers, they tend to be very salient. We tend to notice them and they create this, you know, false internal pressure. This is the reason I raise it. And I want to say it's not like they eventually, you know, fail and dissolve into a puddle of their own tears. Like, hopefully they're resilient and they push forward in life.
Starting point is 02:35:57
And some of them do amazing things and some of them do less amazing things. But the point is that there are people among our species that seem to do many, many things very, very well. And I think when we hold ourselves to that standard, we suffer and we hold ourselves back. I think that I believe, I just have a central belief that we all do have some unique gifts
Starting point is 02:36:19
that we're meant to bring to our life and to the world. And it shows up in different forms. And one of the worst things we can do in trying to find that and express it is trying to be really good at everything. I just think that's the most poisonous idea in the American mindset that we're supposed to be really good at everything.
Starting point is 02:36:38
On the other hand, I personally believe that we should try a variety of things so that we experience frustration and fail and eventually find what it is that is, you know, we're quote unquote meant to do. I do, but I feel also very fortunate that I was never really pushed to be excellent at everything. I have terrible hand-eye coordination,
Starting point is 02:36:56
but I'm pretty good at sports with my feet. But when I say pretty good, I mean passable. So I gave up on the idea of becoming a professional athlete very, very young. So I think we have to know that we had to play games with our hands and our feet in order to figure that out. Yeah, and I guess, you know, we were talking about this maybe before we started, but I don't know.
Starting point is 02:37:14
I'm trying to think why this is, but I tend not to put anyone on a pedestal. I feel like, and maybe part of it is in part of my private practice for years, I saw, maybe I saw the Stanford grads who were then living in New York. And they weren't literally from Stanford, but I'd have all these late 20-year-olds
Starting point is 02:37:34
and their pedigree all look the same, top of their class, Ivy League, Goldman Sachs, this, MBA. And so many of them had the same, like insane anxiety and emptiness. I still remember the way one of them described how they felt and she was brilliant with her words. And she said, I walk around and it's like, when I'm with people and doing things and at work,
Starting point is 02:38:03
it's like, there's a ton of color. When I'm alone, I feel like I am an empty room with white walls. Oh goodness. That's very sad. Very sad. Very sad. It actually has a happy ending,
Starting point is 02:38:15
which is really, has a nuanced ending, but happy ending where she feeling, it's actually, I was actually saying this to a friend because it actually relates to my own childhood. I feel like I've, you know, grown a lot, had my therapy, and I feel like when I was younger, I was really hard driving and really like somewhat people pleasing. And me and my friend who are both like that, were like that, have kids who aren't really like that. And they're amazing kids and they do so well and they have this internal confidence.
Starting point is 02:38:51
But sometimes we joke, we're like, but there's nothing that will drive you like feeling not good enough. There's nothing that drives you like feeling like every test score defines your self-worth. And it's so sick, right? Because we're almost like conflicted with our kids. Like they're all great kids, they're responsible,
Starting point is 02:39:10
but they almost have a little bit more inner contentment. Right? But I think about that young woman I saw and how at work she felt amazing until, didn't happen until she was 28, she didn't get the promotion she thought she was getting. And then, I mean, she never failed before. And it's not only the never failure, when your internal sense of self is built outside in, which you actually can do if you have a lot of accomplishments.
Starting point is 02:39:46
It works for a while. But as soon as that stops working, if you have nothing, you feel like in an empty room with white walls. What's really compelling about the therapy over the course of a number of years is I still remember over COVID, we were then zooming and she'd had her own place and she actually went through this process and she was very artistic of painting the walls
Starting point is 02:40:14
in her actual room, talking about making something concrete and like kind of in the way that she was feeling a lot more lit up inside out instead of outside in. It's great. But I just think, I guess I know myself too, and maybe this is part of why I try not to put people on a pedestal. Maybe it's as I'm talking, people are like, oh, Becky gets it right with her kids and she's doing this and like, whatever I can share, like that is part of my story. I also yell at my kids.
Starting point is 02:40:39
I also feel like sometimes I'm on my phone too much. I feel like my life is at a balance. I don't get to see my friends nearly the way I used to. They probably often are like, where's Becky? Why is she not, you know, not only responding to texts, but remembering my birthday or whatever I forget. And that doesn't feel good to me because I used to do more of that.
Starting point is 02:40:55
And so no one, no one has it all figured out. Like humans, I think that's why, are remarkably complicated, remarkably imperfect. We all have parts of us that feel really good, and maybe some of us play up those parts more than others, and we all have parts of us that feel confusing, maybe have some shame, feel, I don't know, just more complicated.
Starting point is 02:41:23
And so I at least want to get that out there about myself. Oh, I really appreciate you sharing. And I want to be clear, if I was at all unclear, that I certainly don't hold up these ultra performers in all domains on a pedestal. I think they're in a very precarious place inside and outside. They've essentially given up all their power and agency to one incoming failure.
Starting point is 02:41:46
And maybe they never experienced it and they get to the end without having done it, but what a terrible way to live anyway. I've always looked up, since I was little, to people that really took a unique path. I've always found that they, yes, accomplished tremendous things and they have interesting, sometimes painful flaws.
Starting point is 02:42:04
Like I'm a huge fan of the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, very incredible man, very complicated life. Incredible. You know, if you read his books and his autobiography, which I highly recommend everybody do if you're interested in science and just animals and a life uniquely lived.
Starting point is 02:42:23
He's a really good example. And there are a bunch of other examples that are meaningful to me. Certainly not somebody who, you know, he couldn't do an experiment to save his life. He was moved out of multiple universities and places, you know, very, very complicated character. Had a methamphetamine addiction,
Starting point is 02:42:40
was a closet homosexual, came out later in life and was then at long periods of time on his own. Then anyway, had a great relationship later in life. Very interesting person became that way and found his passion by realizing how terrible he was at certain things, including certain branches of medicine. So I think that trying many things
Starting point is 02:43:03
and being really realistic about whether or not something's for us or not, but is the key. But then I guess the question becomes, and this must be so hard from the perspective of parenting, but also just in terms of guiding ourselves through life is how much friction do we experience before we say, you know what, like, I'm not a musician and I'm cool with that.
Starting point is 02:43:22
I love music, but I'm gonna put my efforts into these other things. And this thing comes more easily for me. I do think we have a lot of natural tendencies. And I feel like, especially in the United States, there's been this complicated relationship with parenting and education, whereby we don't wanna push people to their own,
Starting point is 02:43:39
like suffering and demise, but we also have to avoid not pushing them because then they don't ever find what they are proficient in and they don't learn that overcoming friction thing. So it's tricky. I do believe everyone has a unique expression of themselves in life, whatever that is. It doesn't have to be in professional life, but to try a lot of different things. And at what point you bail out.
Starting point is 02:44:02
I mean, I've had few in my lab, but I've spoken to graduate students in postdocs where I had to say, you know what? I actually had this conversation with a postdoc. I was like, you know what? You're a really good scientist. You're never gonna be a professor. Let's get you a job in biotech.
Starting point is 02:44:16
And they were like, oh. They thought their whole life they were gonna be a professor. I'm like, you're not. And the data are the following, which point to that. And it's kind of devastating. But then years later, they then years later they thanked me, or they thanked me in that case.
Starting point is 02:44:28
A few others probably cursed me. So how do you know when to keep pushing your kid to even engage in something? Like maybe they're the kid that always is picked last for the team, but you know they should play sports. So I guess my first reaction is I'm reacting to the word pushing,
Starting point is 02:44:48
because I'm not sure that's the, like the verb I would think about. Because I think the idea of pushing your kid, even like how much do I push, there's a lot about us there, is that my desire? I guess I grew up in a town where a lot of kids got pushed. Oh, I mean, I grew up in a town where every kid got pushed. So maybe that's why I know something about it, right?
Starting point is 02:45:08
I mean, I think we see this all the time. And it goes back to actually what side of the tennis court, like whose feelings are whose? Like, is this my unlived dreams as a athlete in my youth? Or is this actually about my kid's soccer skills? You know, I think parents watching their kids playing sports is a prime example of am I living out my unfulfilled dreams and projecting that onto my daughter?
Starting point is 02:45:34
Or does my daughter like soccer? And how can I really differentiate those? I think actually though, making it back to that, a lot of this actually goes back to frustration tolerance and why it matters so much to me. Like my approach to teaching frustration tolerance, which is like a hidden gem we have here at Couldnside, I really want to be in every school. I think it needs to be in every school and I want to describe it to you, okay? So I literally have this graph, it's helpful and I know you like to write things down too to make it concrete.
Starting point is 02:46:06
We're like, point one is not knowing how to do something. Okay? And point two, which is very far away, is let's say knowing how to do it or being very proficient. This could be soccer. I think a good example is reading. Okay?
Starting point is 02:46:21
Like everybody starts out not knowing how to read. And let's say, not everybody, but a lot of people learn how to read. The space between not knowing and knowing, I call the learning space. It has a name, and it's helpful to know where you are in a map. And the learning space has one feeling that you're supposed to have. Frustration. That is the feeling you're supposed to have. And we have this idea that we share from not knowing to knowing like this.
Starting point is 02:46:57
It's because of those damn Star Wars movies. Oh, no, actually, Star Wars incorporated some frustration, but it's because of movies. Boom, you're supposed to just have the skill because you picked up the rock or the sword or the pen or the wand. Well, and now it's because if you think about the circuitry that kids get used to with dopamine and the space between wanting and having in general is,
Starting point is 02:47:20
well, because when you don't know something, you want to know it. Here, you do know it. Our tolerance and our kids' tolerance for wanting and not having is so low that what's so sad is the learning space has gotten massively compressed and people fear frustration. This image, when I've gone over this with kids and even teachers, I know teachers who teach this in their class, okay, today we're gonna learn this new thing. We're gonna learn whatever it is,
Starting point is 02:47:46
you know, how to read a short word. Everybody in this class is here, not knowing. Everybody in this class is going to get here. And probably today, most of us, and you can actually do it now, are gonna be right here. What does this say? The learning space. How are we supposed to feel when we're in the learning space? The class
Starting point is 02:48:07
can say, frustrated. Okay, here's an interesting assignment, different than you think. The goal today is not to tell me if you can read the letters that are in front of you. I want you to raise your hand when you feel frustrated, which feels like this. Oh, I can't do it because I'm going to come up to you and I'm going to give you a high five and I'm going to say, you are in the learning space. You are learning. How amazing is that? Andrew, I really believe this has the power to change learning.
Starting point is 02:48:34
Because then when we talk about proficiency or when we talk about years from now, my kid is saying this happens all the time. I get questions about this all the time. My kid says they want to do whatever it is. It could be a coding class, it could be a lacrosse class, and they do it once, and then they always come home, and they say, I wanna do it, I quit. Or maybe they're on a swim team, and they wanna quit.
Starting point is 02:48:55
Do I let my kid quit? To me, the question is actually, most likely none of our kids are gonna to be Olympic swimmers or like professional basketball players. I think about this a lot with youth sports. The whole goal in my mind for most people with youth sports, not everyone, but most, is learning how to deal with frustration, learning how to do things you thought you couldn't do, character, sharing, being a good teammate, sportsmanship, right?
Starting point is 02:49:22
All those things are hard skills to learn. So the reason I'm signing my kid up for basketball is actually just cause it's like a good medium for all those things. And so I wanna be sure that if my kid is quitting, it's not because they're escaping the very, very natural learning space that is so important to be in in life.
Starting point is 02:49:42
And this happened, actually, my oldest wanted to quit baseball. He'd played for years and he wanted to quit. And the conversation we ended up having was, look, let's wait till the end of the season. Like, and this goes back to values. It's not we don't quit, but like in our family, we really value and try as much as we can
Starting point is 02:50:02
to keep our commitments and not just to ourselves, to each other. And so the rest of the season, you might be thinking all the time, I don't wanna be doing this. And again, in my head, I'm thinking, good, that's like a good life experience to watch yourself go through that, as long as it's not toxic.
Starting point is 02:50:16
And at the end, you know, we'll talk about it. Interestingly enough, he had the best baseball season he'd ever had. He had a Grand Slam, which no shade to baseball. That's as exciting as youth baseball ever gets, right? And still, he was like, I think I'm done. I just want to... And I felt really good about that.
Starting point is 02:50:34
I was like, look, you ended on like, you were playing really well. It wasn't just because you got moved down in the batting order. Like, if that's the reason why I could get moved down to the batting order, they're not starting on basketball, I hear this all the time, now they wanna quit.
Starting point is 02:50:48
I don't have any rigid rules, but if that becomes a pattern, that worries me, or not worries me, but forget you sports. That's just not a great circuitry that would be conducive with kind of resilience and confidence in adulthood. Look, I love, love, love this concept, which I believe to be entirely true, that the learning space between unskilled and skilled, if you will, is characterized by the feeling of frustration
Starting point is 02:51:20
in mind and body. I don't want to rattle off another experiment, but there is just oh, so much data. I'll share this with you offline. The papers that is showing that brain plasticity changes in neural circuitry only occur when the chemical milieu of the brain is different than it normally is. Otherwise, how would the brain know it should change?
Starting point is 02:51:41
So what sets the context for massive change in our neural circuitry is when there's a lot of adrenaline in the body. Sorry, folks, it's true, adrenaline also called epinephrine and norepinephrine released in the brain. Now you don't want to be in a state of panic or stress to the point where you're debilitated, but that shift in the chemical milieu sets the stage for rewiring of connections between neurons. I mean, this is known at the molecular level,
Starting point is 02:52:08
it's known at the cellular level, it's known at the circuit level, and I'm excited to share that literature with you because it just basically is a bunch of nerd speak and numbers to support the fact that you're nailing it right in the bull's eye, which is without frustration, there is no rewiring of the neural circuits.
Starting point is 02:52:26
And if you think about it, it had to be that way. Otherwise, why would the circuits change? So that the error signal is what sets plasticity in motion. Now the actual rewiring occurs during sleep. So this is my reminder to make sure that your kids get enough sleep, because that's when the actual, this is the phenomenon of not being able to do something
Starting point is 02:52:42
coming back a few days or weeks later. And you're like, can do it. Well, it's because it happened in sleep, the final portion of the rewiring. That's why phones shouldn't be in the bedroom for kids. I think 75% of people between the age of seven and 18 are massively sleep deprived. And the neural rewiring deficits associated with that
Starting point is 02:53:02
are serious, and these are what we call sensitive periods. I like sensitive periods more than critical periods because critical periods imply an open and shut. Sensitive, there's a tapering, but it does taper. So this unskilled to skilled and frustration in the learning space model, this is part of something that you're putting together now. Could you expand on that? I already have it.
Starting point is 02:53:23
I mean, our frustration tolerance program, it's a workshop. It's within our membership, right? So it's one of 30 workshops. To me, it's one where, you know, the thing is no parents say, Dr. Becky, what I'm really dealing with is low frustration tolerance. You know, they'll say, my kid is having tantrums or they won't do their homework or kids with ADHD tend to have low frustration tolerance, right? So to me, it's like one of the first things I recommend to new members where I say, okay,
Starting point is 02:53:52
you might like, this is the thing. This is like the key thing that underlies a lot of tantrums. It underlies entitlement. It underlies not sharing. It underlies why you throw the board game when you're about to lose. It underlies quitting. It's not homework. And again, the MGI, the most generous interpretation is wait, right, the commonality in all those situations
Starting point is 02:54:14
is my kid is frustrated. And if what they're learning or what they've practiced is when I feel frustrated, it's so intense that sometimes I think like, do our kids learn that their emotions operate on a dimmer switch or an on-off switch? We want our kids to operate on a dimmer. Like you said, if you're at a 10 out of 10, you can't operate. But if every time, and I'm so interested in this literature you mentioned, because I was thinking, what would happen in the first number of years of a kid's life if every time they're frustrated?
Starting point is 02:54:45
Well intentioned, but again, just under-resourced parents turn it off. Then what I think would happen, and I'm wondering, is then something that could be like a five out of 10, I feel like would feel like a 10 out of 10, because you never had a dimmer, right? Because if you only operated when a light went on with always going off, then even if over time, years later, the light was at a five, it's still gonna feel blinding, right?
Starting point is 02:55:13
And so this idea of a dimmer, you want your kids when they're frustrated. That's what frustration tolerance is. Nobody says, I'm frustrated, I can't read, yay. No one says that. But if it kind of comes up, ooh, there's that light. We want their bodies to think, okay, all I need to do, and I have skills to get my nine out of 10 to an eight,
Starting point is 02:55:34
an eight to a seven. When I'm at a seven, that's where learning happens. That's very different than it's at a nine, and kind of like, who's gonna turn it off for me? Or the reason in those situations kids say, I'm not doing my homework, is they don't have the skills to bring it to a seven. And so their choice is to stay at a nine or 10 out of 10,
Starting point is 02:55:54
which no human can do, or walk away and bring it to a zero. And so what I'm saying is our frustration tolerance workshop, which I want every parent to take, but I also just wanna get into schools, is literally the thing that helps you teach your kids how to get frustration taunts. How to, you really can do this. It sounds sick, but like you can get your kids to like being in the learning space,
Starting point is 02:56:18
to be like, I'm going to thrive here. The good feeling is eventually going to come. I'm relatively comfortable here because I just have watched myself survive it that many times. And so the benefits of that workshop and just the program is not only tantrums, but actually it is a lot in academics. Because that, so many times when kids have issues in school. I'm not, ADHD is real, dyslexia is real. That definitely can be a component. But so many times,
Starting point is 02:56:49
it's actually an issue of frustration, tolerance, and that's often not kind of labeled for parents. I'm realizing as you're saying this, that the literature that I'm aware of about stress and trauma is actually relevant here in an interesting and perhaps surprising way whereby, this thing I said earlier, the brain only changes under conditions
Starting point is 02:57:11
where norepinephrine and epinephrine are released. There is such a thing as one trial learning and it's associated with negative experiences. And the reason negative experiences create such robust learning in only one trial is because there's a massive amount of epinephrine and norepinephrine and other neurochemicals released. So it's stamped into the nervous system.
Starting point is 02:57:31
But learning of things we want to learn relies on the same neurochemicals. I mean, there's a wild and really cool literature from a guy named James McGaugh, who showed that like, if you spike adrenaline before learning, the learning is much faster and much more durable, if you spike adrenaline before learning, the learning is much faster and much more durable. If you spike adrenaline after learning,
Starting point is 02:57:49
turns out the learning is more durable. Now we can't start getting into kind of, you know, biohacking experiments on kids or themselves, but the adrenaline is supposed to come during the learning itself, which is what you're saying. But the problem is, if we stop once we're frustrated, we get the increase in adrenaline and norepinephrine, and again, other neurochemicals as well.
Starting point is 02:58:13
But then the perception is that the plasticity loop is closed there. So what did you learn? When I do hard things, I get frustrated. When I stop, the frustration goes away. That's all you learn. In the same way that somebody exposed to trauma, this underlies the basis of almost all
Starting point is 02:58:27
modern trauma therapies is that in the right setting, take people back through it sequentially, let them experience that and start to desensitize to it so they can complete that loop. Yeah, that's exactly right. And so I think it's so important to push through frustration. And I think it's so important as you,
Starting point is 02:58:46
I'm just agreeing with you here clearly, but that oftentimes that frustration can last more than just the learning session. It can be weeks or months or in some cases, a year of a really challenging course or a sports participation. And so that's where it gets tough because as empathic creatures, one hopes,
Starting point is 02:59:05
we hate to see members of our own species suffer, especially our kids. And so it becomes this thing of like, do you let them opt out? Like, what did they learn by opting out? And that's where it gets really complicated because we also got a forebrain which can set all these different rules.
Starting point is 02:59:20
And so... But can I... I don't know about frustration for a year. I guess I always think how we experience a feeling is the feeling plus the story we tell ourselves about the feeling. And the feeling kind of is at a certain level, but the story we tell ourselves about the feeling and what it means about us
Starting point is 02:59:41
or how capable we are of coping with it, that can make a feeling that was here go to here. Something about frustration of a year. Like, it's interesting, we're talking so much about stories. But again, if one of the things I try as a parent is when my kid is saying, I don't know, what would it be to quit? You know, I hate gymnastics, right? And you're thinking, okay, like, first of all, quitting is not always weak or wrong. Sometimes quitting's a very brave, awesome, great thing to do.
Starting point is 03:00:12
So, great. Definitely sometimes the absolute best thing to do. A hundred percent. But as a parent sometimes, and I get this a lot, like, I'm conflicted, like, I don't know what's right. First of all, there's probably not a right. And again, our parenting never hangs on one decision. So just let that go.
Starting point is 03:00:27
But I think what I would be curious to just experiment with, again, maybe it's because I'm so obsessed with frustration tolerance, especially in this world, that is so working against frustration tolerance. I feel like it's like even more of my duty is apparent to help. So I'm like, okay, let's just have an experiment. Where I would say, okay, talk to me about why you want to quit gymnastics.
Starting point is 03:00:48
And I might know in the back of my head, maybe they're not as good as everyone anymore. Right? Or maybe they just don't like it. Who knows? But I might say, you know, look, maybe this isn't relevant. I'm thinking about when I did, you know, I'm thinking about a different sport. When I did, you know, I'm thinking about a different sport, when I did track growing up. And there were like whole years where I was like, I love track, I love track. And I don't know if I ever told you this,
Starting point is 03:01:12
but when I was 11, I hated track. I went from love to hate it. And part of it was, and again, say something kind of relevant to your kid, part of it was there was a new kid at school and I was kind of the track star until she came in and then I was like second and that just kind of stunk and no, I didn't tell myself it's okay. I kind of told myself this stinks every day and part of it was all my friends were doing soccer and I kind of felt left out.
Starting point is 03:01:38
But I finished the year and the next year something interesting happened. And this is what a kid will say. I'll go, oh what, you love track again? And it's this amazing moment, cuz they're always gonna say that, to be like, no, no. I ended up deciding that next year is my last year at track, and I stopped after that. But can't explain it, it just, it felt like it came from a different place. And almost like I felt more settled, I think, after, like I really knew.
Starting point is 03:02:08
And I don't know if that's relevant to gymnastics. I do know you've loved it for a while. It's kind of new to not like it. And sometimes when something's new and you don't like it, you just gotta go. But other times when something's new and you don't like it, you wanna like figure it out. And I don't know, I'm wondering if we should give it
Starting point is 03:02:26
a few more weeks to try the figuring it out thing. And again, maybe your kid says, no, I want to quit. And you're like, fine. And in some ways you've already had the experience no matter what they do. But I think that's what I think about playing around with, with kids way more than I think what parents say is, should they quit or not? It's so binary, it's so rigid.
Starting point is 03:02:49
And I think we're missing the nuance of the story and the process that matters more than the eventual decision. I love your use of story in narrative with your kids. It seems like you use that a lot. I do. Instead of saying, you know, and forgive me for, I'm not an analyst, but I feel like it starts
Starting point is 03:03:11
with an observation, like, okay, you're behaving this way, maybe what's behind the behavior, or you're expressing this, what's maybe deeper to that. But when talking about your own experiences towards your kids, as you've been doing here in these pseudo hypotheticals, I'm sure some of them is this will interview your kids later and find out, no, I'm kidding. It's clear that you use story as a way to kind of
Starting point is 03:03:33
share genuinely, but also probe what might be going on with them. And I have to say, I find it really delightful because it raises lots of questions that I think anyone would have. And I think it's part of your gift clearly because so many people follow your advice. But the advice you give is also, it's interesting.
Starting point is 03:04:01
It's like an observation, like frustration is key. I want to increase frustration tolerance, but then you're not like, okay, you're gonna hammer it's like an observation, like frustration is key, I wanna increase frustration tolerance, but then you're not like, okay, you're gonna hammer down their throats frustration tolerance in the following way. It sort of becomes a question, like where's their frustration in your life? And then you put it into your own narrative
Starting point is 03:04:17
as opposed to necessarily asking them questions. I think asking kids questions or asking people questions generally is great, like, hey, how can I do better, As you pointed out earlier, but it's really, I don't know if the word is disarming, but it's really in an entirely positive way. We like to use your own narrative to allow people to start going, oh yeah,
Starting point is 03:04:38
like where am I experiencing frustration? Where can I tolerate that better? And so I think that there's this incredible triad of like, or tripartite thing of like observe, consider like the deeper layer and then offering a narrative that's really a bunch of questions when where you're speaking from your real truth.
Starting point is 03:05:00
It's really elegant, I have to say. Thank you. It's spectacular. I hadn't realized it until right now. I don't know if I realized those parts, but you know what is interesting is it brings up the word we kind of mentioned before but didn't talk about, and maybe it'll be surprising that I say this, is shame.
Starting point is 03:05:14
And I think shame is the biggest blocker to learning. And shame, I think, can be defined, like, a lot of things in many ways. But it's the experience of aloneness. I think shame is the feeling you have when you kind be defined like a lot of things in many ways, but it's the experience of aloneness. I think shame is the feeling you have when you kind of feel like a part of you is not attachable. So for a kid, that's an existential threat to not be in attachment with someone. And in that way, when you're not attachable, you're alone.
Starting point is 03:05:39
You're alone. And so, so many of the things that happen with our kids, because I'll model another story and maybe I'll get some flack for this because it's probably counterintuitive. But I think about like one of my kids, my resilient rebel who was in a hitting stage when he was younger, hitting and he was just also in like a couple weeks, he was hitting and then there was this one time where we were doing a family puzzle, and he was younger. He was probably like three. It was really hard.
Starting point is 03:06:09
It was more for my older kids. He was kind of doing his own thing. I think he was putting the blocks on the side. We leave, we come back, and like a couple of the puzzle pieces were missing that were in. And I just knew, I knew it. He saw it. I know most generous interpretation.
Starting point is 03:06:24
He felt like, oh my God, I can't participate in what the rest of the family is doing. And so you know what I'm gonna do? Cause I'm a smart kid. I'm just gonna stop them from participating. And so I'm gonna take the puzzle pieces and hide them. I knew it. I know.
Starting point is 03:06:39
So he'd come back and we'd worked really hard on this puzzle. Of course you're angry, but again, I can either do nothing on the outside or do nothing on the inside. In that moment, not always, but chose to be an adult. And I was just like, I know you took the puzzle pieces. I just want, you know, and he's like, what are you talking?
Starting point is 03:06:54
No, I didn't. You know, maybe he's four. No, I didn't. And I was like, we're working on this puzzle. I get that is probably frustrating, but like you need, I'm not, I didn't have the puzzle pieces. That was not working. And then this is truly going back to stories
Starting point is 03:07:09
and going back to shame. If you feel like you're the bad kid who's doing bad things and you're the only one who's like that, you are shut down from learning. So I went up to him on the couch and my husband I remember watching me being like, and this is how I started I go I don't know if I can tell you this which any kids would be like I don't know if I can tell you this. When I was probably about seven I did something really bad that's what I said he was like, I can't even tell you.
Starting point is 03:07:47
He was like, he like, every part of his anger like diffused. And you can really draw a kid in by just saying to them, I can't tell you, I've never told anyone. I go, okay, and this is true. I go, my sister was too, and she had these oily stickers, and I really wanted them. And I asked my mom, and she said, no, we couldn't go to the store. No, those are my sister's stickers. And you're never gonna guess what I did. And he was like, I don't know, you asked her for them, you waited. And I was like, you asked her for them, you waited, you know. And I was like, no, I took them.
Starting point is 03:08:28
But that's not the worst part. He's like, what? And I go, my mom asked me if I took them. I knew I did, so you know what I told her. And he said, you told her yes. And I go, no. I told her no. And he literally goes. And I feel like in that moment, what's happening
Starting point is 03:08:55
is he's saying so many things that you can never say didactically. Mom, you're my mom. I love you. I hold you on a pedestal. And even you did something that wasn't so great. Mom, like, you're my mom, I love you, I hold you on a pedestal, and like, even you did something that wasn't so great. There's like so much hope and goodness.
Starting point is 03:09:12
And then I didn't, in that moment, I did not say, and you cannot say in these situations, so now you can tell me that you just have to like trust. Because I think the shame of the badness, shame freezes you, right, as an animal defense state, right, shame freezes you. So a kid who's lying to you is always in shame. And you can't get a kid to unfreeze and move to a different place of telling you the truth if you're adding more shame through fear.
Starting point is 03:09:43
Like the math doesn't work, but you can through stories. Now, true story, he did not right after that say, you know, I was just like, I remember my husband, how he said, okay, when he's saying this, he was like, we have to punish him. We have to, you know, we have to punish him. I was like, in the moment, that's gonna feel very cathartic to us.
Starting point is 03:10:03
That's what punishment does. It makes you feel very powerful. It makes you feel very cathartic to us. That's what punishment does. It makes you feel very powerful. It makes you feel very cathartic. It doesn't work. It just doesn't, especially not with kids who are strong-willed. I was like, just give it a couple days. It was probably a good three days later. And he brought me the puzzle pieces in a bag.
Starting point is 03:10:20
And he just said, I took them. bag. And he just said, I took them. And he truly started crying. And I did not lecture him. I feel like the whole arc, the whole lesson had basically already happened. Honestly, like the day after or so, again, and this is what I think we miss as parents and like, we're almost afraid to like just name the humanness of it. And I kind of gave an example earlier. He's going to want to do something bad again. We all want to do bad things. That's not a bad urge. It's just about having the skills to do something differently when you have the urge.
Starting point is 03:10:55
So I think a couple days later, and I do this, I do this at a like role plays. They take like 20 seconds. I was like, Oh my goodness. Look at the puzzle, because we'd still been working on it. What if you want to take it again? He goes, I won't. I go, I know, but I think you might want to. Remember how I took the oilies?
Starting point is 03:11:12
So you're acknowledging that inside him, there might be a piece that still wants to do the wrong thing. Feelings, and that's an urge. I teach my kids, an urge means you want to do something. My kids will say, an urge is not a behavior. Behavior is doing the thing. That's not okay.
Starting point is 03:11:26
But the only reason your urge doesn't convert into behavior is because you have a skill to manage the urge. And you can't build skills if no one teaches you them. So I said, what could you do instead? Could you run to me and say, I really wanna take the pieces? Can you say, I need time with you? Because at the end of the day, I think he felt left out.
Starting point is 03:11:43
And we did. And by the way, this kid, is he like perfect now? No. But it brings together so many things. When, number one, when we trust ourselves that we have time, when we realize shame, the fear of being the only one, being bad, being unlovable, being alone, is often the biggest blocker for kids.
Starting point is 03:12:04
When you really realize that, punishment and sending your kid away makes no sense at all. And you can kind of give yourself freedom to tell stories, right? Because when we're really struggling with something, you don't want to look at someone, especially someone who's perfect, right? It's like when you really have a bad experience as an adult,
Starting point is 03:12:25
the only thing you want to hear is your friend who I don't like, you know, I'm mortified. I sent this email to my boss. The only thing that would make me feel better is someone like, let me show you the email I sent. I'm like, oh, wow, that's worse. That's the only thing that makes me feel better. Not because I wish bad upon other people,
Starting point is 03:12:41
but because you want to know you're not alone. And other people's stories do that, like vulnerability. It's kind of like, it's like this magic, this magic trick. I mean, it's pretty far away from the parenting dynamic, but the understanding and actual data from like 12 step programs and group therapy generally, including trauma therapy that is of a group therapy nature, fully supports everything you said. Hearing the terrible and or humiliating things
Starting point is 03:13:17
that people have done or have done to them as awful as that sounds, is often what underlies people's willingness to recover, ability to recover, and then they become the teachers over time. Like you said, I think you said so many incredible things there, but right at the end, you said something that I hope everyone internalizes, that when you do something embarrassing,
Starting point is 03:13:38
maybe even humiliating, the last thing you want to hear is, look, it's all going to be fine. The thing that actually helps is somebody who has experienced something similar and is doing fine. Yeah. And I use that at management. We had someone do a presentation at work, and it was for a bunch of people,
Starting point is 03:13:55
and it did not go well. And I met with her, and she knew it kind of didn't go well. And honestly, the only thing I said to her, I don't even manage her directly. She's more junior. And I really mean this. We had, in psychology, grad school, like it's intense.
Starting point is 03:14:07
You do a session when you're first doing sessions and like everyone's watching you. They're like watching you do therapy, which is helpful. But I remember my first one and I felt like pretty okay about it. I was like, this is my first one. I was okay. I got torn to shreds.
Starting point is 03:14:22
They were like, that was not good. And now obviously I'm on the, I feel good about my clinical abilities, but the only thing I said to her is I was like, look, and I shared it with her. And I said like, I've been there. Like, eventually I look back on that, helped me learn. That day I just fell awful.
Starting point is 03:14:43
I wasn't like, this is my learning space moment, you know? And so if you're feeling like that, I just want to let you know, like, I've been there too. This is the starting point to getting better. This is gonna like make you stronger. I know that I've lived that. And I think storytelling in that way is probably like a really underutilized kind of quote tool, almost dehumanizes it to call it that, in management and in any relationship. Love it. And I feel like the story of your son bringing
Starting point is 03:15:11
those puzzle pieces back is like, there's so much there. So much. And the fact that there was a delay and then he brought it back on his own accord and that you had already kind of let it go, that's, I feel like, a really interesting piece. It wasn't to appease you.
Starting point is 03:15:28
It was really something internal for him. Like, he got the lesson for him. It wasn't just about making mom feel okay about him. Like, he clearly understood you still love him, but it wasn't about fixing something externally as much as it was about fixing something internally, which I think is the addressing and overcoming the shame piece. I think that's right.
Starting point is 03:15:49
And that's the thing. I think sometimes it's like, are we teaching kids what to think or how to think? After they're gone from our house, it's the how to think. And you said questions. I love kind of Socratic questions for kids. Like, oh, if again, a different version of a story would be like, oh, okay, I know you didn't take the puzzle pieces, but I'm just thinking for me, like, what would make me take puzzle pieces? Oh, I wonder if
Starting point is 03:16:16
I felt left out or I wonder if I was just really trying to get my parents' attention for a while and this was the only way to do it. And what would I do after? And what would I need? Now I'm going to get emotional. What would I need to know about myself or from my parent for me to share that I did take it? Maybe I would need to know that my parents knew I was a good kid. Anyway, sorry, what were we talking about?
Starting point is 03:16:43
Because your kids eventually make a decision, adults make a decision for themselves because they ask themselves the right questions. Not because they've heard their parents specific lesson, right? Because they're able to say to themselves, like, what am I feeling right now? What am I really looking for? Why did I do that? So like asking questions, telling stories, asking questions without even answering them actually provokes a much more sophisticated
Starting point is 03:17:08
developmental process in your kid than the lectures we all, me included. Trust me, plenty of times at my kid that I've just lectured them. But again, they're just catharsis. They're not actually terribly effective. Yeah. If ever there was some core truths about brain plasticity, it's that frustration is associated
Starting point is 03:17:29
with the chemicals that foster brain change. We know that. And that questions have a really interesting impact on learning, which sounds kind of like a duh. Well, of course they do. But when we ask questions, it creates this open loop in the brain that the brain wants to solve as opposed to hearing a statement. That's why I always felt like those pictures on office walls like motivation, when you
Starting point is 03:17:51
blah, blah, blah, like motivational statements don't mean much in terms of because they're not about verb states. When we ask questions, we put our brain into kind of a process of verb states of asking what behaviors are going to lead to which outcomes. There's an interesting literature about this that probably isn't fully relevant here, but it gets back to trying to learn basic motor tasks, and the same things are applied to basic cognitive tasks,
Starting point is 03:18:14
of like, how do I solve this? And that puzzle is a great example because it's both cognitive and motor, like you're fixing these pieces in different ways. I have to get back to doing some puzzles I'm realizing. And emotional. You know, I can really embarrass myself, but one of my favorite things that I, again, I've just noticed my kids extending for puzzles, because they all did a lot of puzzles when
Starting point is 03:18:34
they were young, is so funny. I remember my kid doing like this puzzle and getting some frustration. What I did is I did a puzzle to the side of him. Instead of doing it perfectly, I kind of mimicked. I was like, oh, this doesn't fit. Oh, it's not that piece. And one of the things I noticed, this is when my kid was really young,
Starting point is 03:18:53
he, kids have a really hard time with puzzles and it's kind of a metaphor for life. For when a piece doesn't fit, they keep trying it. When what they really need to do is, it's such a metaphor, is put it down and pick up another piece, right? But I could tell my kid that, but I'm not, I always feel like just telling doesn't really work. So that's what I did, not joking.
Starting point is 03:19:14
I'm gonna sing, get ready, okay? So I was doing it over here and I just go, oh, it's not fitting, it's not fitting here, it's not fitting here. And I go, if it doesn't fit, put it to the side and try another piece. And I was like, oh right, I can put it to the side. Okay, I'll get this one. And I didn't make it perfect, I was like, oh, oh, oh, that one fits there, right? I have heard, not anymore, my kids are too old, but there was a time, I remember me and my husband were outside the playroom and we heard our son like singing this song.
Starting point is 03:19:55
It's just, it's a mantra, it's self-regulation because is it cognitive, is it physical? It's also emotional. It goes back to frustration tolerance where our kids need. They need mantras. They need skills. They need songs to actually up-level their skills to regulate the emotions that get in
Starting point is 03:20:15
their way of doing great things. Right? And that kid is interesting, like not really anymore, now that I think about it. I want to revive it. He makes up songs through situations. What an amazing skill, right? But this stuff can like, and if anyone's hearing this, they're like, oh, that's unrealistic. Like, it's amazing you do it one time, one time.
Starting point is 03:20:36
Make up a silly song, model the frustration yourself, make up a song, struggle again, and then get success. Whatever it is, it could be with reading, with a puzzle, with putting on your sock. It could be, oh, it doesn't fit. I'm taking a deep breath and trying it again. It could literally be anything because it adds a little play and joy. And you probably know what song does in the brain better than I do, but probably regulating. I would put money that apparently, like, that's so weird. Becky, you're right.
Starting point is 03:21:06
It didn't take that much time. I did it one time, and my kids started singing the song, and now they put their socks on by themselves. I love it. You taught a process through song, and there actually is a lot of data on music and the brain and how it organizes things mostly in the form of a story of a beginning, middle, and end. Just the quickest example I can give is,
Starting point is 03:21:24
when we learn our ABCs, we learn them in song. Right, it's ABC, D, F, G, you never forget that, right? It's much easier to learn things through rhythmic song, little motifs, than it is through a list of letters or numbers. So our brain like encode it differently? Yeah, so it fragments it into a beginning,, middle and end, and then there's an underlying repetitive sort of wave, A, B, C, D, E, G, D, D, okay here I'm now, I'm singing, so you
Starting point is 03:21:52
know at risk of, you know, inducing all sorts of bad neural responses in listeners. But you get the point, it's a waveform that the brain can recognize. I actually have a friend who's a very accomplished musician, and I know the lyrics to his songs very well, and I said, remember that song? And he goes, well, I have to hear the underlying melody, and then he can remember all the words. He's a singer. He's a lead singer in a very well-known band.
Starting point is 03:22:16
He doesn't even know the words to his own songs if you just ask them for him, but you give him the music, and he's just out the gate. And he can do this in front of tens of thousands of people. So then it is a cheat code for coping skills if you put it to song. give him the music and he's just out the gate. And he can do this in front of tens of thousands of people. So then it is a cheat code for coping skills if you put it to song. It becomes a verb process.
Starting point is 03:22:30
Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there. It's almost like saying like, oh, the mechanics of writing are you pick up, you put the pen between you, there's a whole rhythm to writing. There's a whole sequence of a motor sequence that we learn or eating or anything for that matter. No one who's an expert piano player thinks about
Starting point is 03:22:47
playing the individual keys at the point where they've learned it, they've batched it into, it's sort of like chunking, but it has an underlying rhythm that's carried by a neural circuit that allows the expression of the movements of the fingers or the words out the mouth, or in this case, overcoming frustration to just kind of ride on top of all of it.
Starting point is 03:23:04
So there's an unconscious genius to what you did. And I love it. Maybe as long as nobody hears me sing, I'll need to sing more to get through frustration. I have a question about Ms. Edson. Yes. People are gonna be like, what? Before we started recording, you shared with us something I think is entirely appropriate about Miss Edson. Yes. People are gonna be like, what?
Starting point is 03:23:25
Before we started recording, you shared with us something I think is entirely appropriate to what we're talking about now, which is learning and learning hard things and frustration tolerance. And you've evolved these concepts, in the course of your work and through your own parenting child relationships, clearly your own and then yours with your kids.
Starting point is 03:23:46
Who was Ms. Edson and what did she teach you? Because when you told me this, I was like, whoa, that's super valuable. We all need to know about this. Yes, so Ms. Edson was my second grade teacher. And I remember writing in her class. And I remember something she told us, and it's truly something that shapes me every day.
Starting point is 03:24:04
And she said, And I remember something she told us, and it's truly something that shapes me every day. And she said, if something feels too hard to start, it just means that the first step isn't small enough. And then she really kind of made this even more concrete, because what I remember in her class writing, and I still use this in writing today, is, okay, so if something feels too hard writing today, is, okay, so if
Starting point is 03:24:25
something feels too hard to do, the implication is, it doesn't mean it's my fault. It doesn't mean I can't. It doesn't mean I'm stupid. It literally just means the first step isn't small enough. That's very actionable. And so the way I play around with it now, even in my own writing, is, okay, I have to write a new article. And I'm like, I can't do that.
Starting point is 03:24:46
Okay, so I'm in I can't mode. Okay, if something is in I can't mode, if it feels too hard, I hear her voice. It just means the first step isn't small enough. So I'll make it literally, I'll just make it smaller. I'm gonna write a page today. And then often I'm like, I can't do that. Okay, smaller.
Starting point is 03:25:01
A paragraph, no. And I literally do it until, and some days it's a word. And I go, oh, you know what? I can write a word. Okay. Now I'm not. Okay. Right. And I really think Ms. Edson was ahead of her time. I mean, obviously now we talk a lot about frustration tolerance, growth mindset, but this really is a way of saying when things are hard, it's not your fault and there's something you can do to build the circuit of capability. Because I think when we're trying to do something hard, there are, like if you think about it,
Starting point is 03:25:34
I don't know, you're on the top of a ski mountain and on the one side is that I can't, it's too hard. And the other side is I can. We all have natural capability. I really believe this, every person. But it's just about figuring out how to get your skis, like to the beginning of the ski slope. And then maybe if we've practiced being on the I can't do hard things slope,
Starting point is 03:25:58
our skis keep trying to turn, but we just have to keep getting them back. And so if we tell ourselves, I can't do this, and we just stay there, stagnant, but if you say, wait, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, like I used this with a client a while ago, I can't ask my boss for a raise, I know I deserve it. Cool, no problem, let's make it smaller. Okay, what would be smaller?
Starting point is 03:26:21
Let's get creative. Could you write down what you would say? Okay, no. Could you say the word to me five times out loud? Raise, raise, raise, raise, raise. I remember she laughed. She goes, I can do that. Cool, let's start there.
Starting point is 03:26:35
Okay, she literally did that. What I think is so powerful about Miss Edson's advice is as soon as we get even our skis a tiny bit into the I can circuit, the I can slope, we're actually just a lot more likely to stay there or at least that becomes a bigger part of our identity, right? So with this woman that I was working on this with, one of the things we were working on, it was just, okay, so you did that.
Starting point is 03:27:01
Amazing. The next thing, I even just had her play around things saying to me, can you say to me, I deserve a raise? It was very interesting. I think this was one of the reasons she had trouble speaking up for it. It was really hard for her to embody that. We said that. She couldn't, I remember a week she said,
Starting point is 03:27:16
I'm gonna write it down and bring it. She didn't. Again, I like parenting. I didn't punish her. I didn't send her to her room. I said, okay, that was just too big. Let's make it smaller. Let's write it together. Wrote some things down there, right?
Starting point is 03:27:27
I then had her write it as an email and send it to me. And I then had her practice it with her best friend. And then she asked her boss for a raise. Like, I mean, like, I don't even, like, probably no one's surprised. Yeah, like, that makes sense. She'd gone through a lot of steps. But it's just applicable in every area of your sense. She'd gone through a lot of steps.
Starting point is 03:27:45
But it's just applicable in every area of your life. So even anyone listening, we all have something in our I can't category. This is too hard or I can't. And we just stay there. And if you hear Ms. Edison saying, wait, if something feels too hard to do, it only means that the first step isn't small enough.
Starting point is 03:28:04
And if then the next smallest step feels too hard, no big it only means that the first step isn't small enough. And if then the next smallest step feels too hard, no biggie, like no judgment, make it smaller, make it smaller, make it smaller, and then allow yourself to eventually build up from there. Love it. Love Miss Edson. I'm going to thank you and Miss Edson. Yes. Thank you, Miss Edson. I think the idea of lowering the stakes to be able to move forward is just spectacular and in everything.
Starting point is 03:28:31
And I noticed you do that, by the way, I'm not like analyzing, I'm just saying, you do that with parenting. I think there's so much tension around this notion of like creating healthy, productive, functional kids. And I think there is a lot of shame for parents when things aren't going great and people know it or they know it and the idea of creating lower stakes
Starting point is 03:28:55
in order to be able to make pretty big moves over time where they're required or just do nothing when sometimes that's what's required. Yeah, and the similarity is so interesting. What I think the powerful thing about Miss Edson's advice is, is she's almost saying, make something small enough so you can get your first win. Having a win is really powerful.
Starting point is 03:29:16
It's kind of addicting. Like, what's my next win? You're on the win circuit. You know, one of the reasons, we want to create so many more resources for parents and when parents come to us and even say, this is a problem, this is a problem, this is a problem, I often just start, I would say, okay, like what is the smallest thing would change that would make you when you go to bed at night? You're like, today was a better day.
Starting point is 03:29:39
Like, there's some bigger stuff, I hear you. Probably not going to tackle that. We'll tackle that in time, but like, I wanna get you a win today. And then all of a sudden, when a parent starts to build, it's kind of their own self-efficacy, their own like, oh wait, I did feel good about that one moment. I did feel more connected to my kid.
Starting point is 03:29:57
I said this one thing. It's momentum, you know? And we have to give ourselves the opportunity to build momentum, which really usually only starts by taking the smallest step anyway. I think it's spectacular. I was going to ask you, and I never do this, but I was gonna ask you if there were one thing
Starting point is 03:30:19
that people could start the process of trying to be a better parent, better to themselves, if it's more about, you know, more about emotional containment, et cetera. Maybe it's this thing of, you know, asking, you know, at the end of today, like what would be one thing that would allow me to have said it was a better day?
Starting point is 03:30:33
Would that be it? And certainly that's powerful. I'm gonna give you two things. One is kind of a one small thing, but it's kind of a bigger theoretical thing. And one thing is very, very, very concrete. So the bigger thing. I really believe that the single biggest thing that gets in our way of feeling more empowered
Starting point is 03:30:53
and capable as parents is that as much as we say we value parenting, and I think parents, people do, or parents are like, yeah, what do I care about more than parenting? It's kind of the lowest on our list in terms of what we invest in. People invest in all types of things. And I want to be clear, yes, we have an offering at Good Inside in our membership, but that's not what I mean. For someone listening, they might be like, there is that parent coach in my town who I've been saying I'm going to call.
Starting point is 03:31:21
Or maybe it's a therapist, or maybe it's a parenting group at your school, or maybe someone listens to me and they're like, no offense, Dr. Becky, there's someone else I follow on Instagram and they have a course and I like them better. I'd be like, do that today. Like align your even purchasing decisions with your values. Like that, and because we're not expected to know this naturally, we're not. to know this naturally.
Starting point is 03:31:45
We're not. And as long as we don't have the resources around us, a little kind of, someone described it to me as like a onesie-toosie thing. Like, it's just not giving ourselves what we deserve. It is like a surgeon saying they're not good at surgery when you find out they never went to medical school or residency. You'd be like, well, you just didn't really get resourced in the way you deserve for this very challenging job.
Starting point is 03:32:08
So that would really be the thing, if I'm really honest, because I'm not, as much as I'm about a quick win, I'm not about a quick fix. I think that just sets us up for more, like a bandaid. Having said that, I love a quick thing. So a couple things I think people can do with their kids. Telling your kid at night, and I'll model how I would say it, like, I think most people, it's not just me, when you put your kid to bed, it's like, oh, you're like, I just want to be on the couch. But it's when your kid's
Starting point is 03:32:32
willing to spend five extra minutes with you, because it's the cruel irony at night, you want time without your kids, and they just want a little bit more time with you. If you allow yourself to lean in, and you can just say to your kid, almost like in a whisper, I think whispering to your kid is one of the most underutilized simplest strategies. Whispers are so sacred, they feel sacred, and they feel like they know they're just for you. Whispering to your kid, like, I just want to tell you, there's nothing you could ever do that would make me stop lovinghmm. Or, I just want to tell you, you're a really good kid. We're in a hard stage, but I will never, ever, ever think of you as anything but a really good kid.
Starting point is 03:33:17
Don't expect your kid to say anything. But just that takes 10 seconds. And if you're like, whispering feels awkward, don't whisper. Just say it. It doesn't matter. If you're thinking, you don't know my kid, they're a teenager, text them. Text them. Sometimes a text to a teen can feel like an unexpected whisper from a parent, you know?
Starting point is 03:33:38
And that's it. And that's the single thing today. And then maybe, I'm going to add a third, just do something like that for yourself. Give yourself credit, put your hand on your heart, tell yourself, experimenting things really hard. I'm doing enough, I'm not messing up my kid forever, that's not a thing. And I've got this.
Starting point is 03:34:00
Awesome. Well, this whole thing that you've attempted to take on is also really hard, and you're doing incredible work educating people on how to parent. There's so many things that you've said today, I'm not going to recap them all. We do timestamps and all that so people can find them, but in no particular order. This concept of telling your right to notice when they notice something important in you or in others or in themselves, that rigidity is the enemy.
Starting point is 03:34:34
Asking like what's this really about when they're doing or saying something or expressing themselves in a way that feels confusing or maybe especially when it's irritating. Encouraging frustration as a route to learning, like incredible. And then you said the more that you can locate somebody, the more you respect their values, which I think is incredible. And on and on.
