Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is David Goggins. David Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's also a highly accomplished ultra marathon runner. For those of you that don't know, ultra-marathons are distances longer than 26 miles. And in David's case, often longer than 200 miles.
Starting point is 00:00:34
For his achievements in athletics, he has been inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame. He also held a Guinness World Record for the most pull-ups completed in 24 hours. I should mention that not only was David a decorated Navy SEAL, but he also graduated from Army Ranger School. David is also a highly successful writer, having authored two books, the first entitled Can't Hurt Me, and the second entitled Never Finished, both of which are best sellers.
Starting point is 00:01:00
David's books cover many topics, including his autobiographical description of what can only be described as an incredibly challenging child and young adulthood. His home was abusive, his school environment was abusive, he essentially had no positive resources directed his way. And in his 20s, he found himself to be obese, that is more than 300 pounds working a job he despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point that David began an inner dialogue that forced him to explore the demons born out of his childhood, but also the position that he found himself in as a young man. And then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform himself into the Navy SEAL, the Ultramarathon runner, the best-selling author, and the extraordinarily positive and influential man that he is today.
Starting point is 00:01:49
As some of you may know, David has done various public lectures. He's a familiar face online, because there are so many clips of him on YouTube, and he has done podcasts before. However, I'm certain that you'll find today's discussion to be very different than previous podcasts that David has been featured on. The reason is that, of course, we get into his accomplishments. We talk about the mindset that allowed him to achieve those things. But today, David really lets us under the hood. He lets us into the form of inter-diolog that he has to embrace, indeed, that he has to grapple with on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times throughout the day and night, in order to impose the sort of self-discipline
Starting point is 00:02:31
that he is so well known for. We also get into some of the scientific mechanisms underlying willpower, and we talk about David's current endeavors that include, for instance, his own exploration of science and medicine for which he has become an intense scholar and practitioner. I should mention that multiple times throughout today's discussion, you will hear curse words. Now, David and I both acknowledge that cursing isn't for everybody and that cursing itself is different than cursing at somebody. Nonetheless, we do realize that many people, parents, perhaps especially, might not want to hear cursing. If you don't want to hear cursing,
Starting point is 00:03:11
well then this podcast episode is probably not for you. However, if you are comfortable with cursing or if you can tolerate it, I assure you, today's discussion is highly worthwhile. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desired effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about
Starting point is 00:03:32
science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Newi Venison. Maui Newi Venison is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available. I've spoken before on this podcast, and there's general consensus that most people should strive to consume
Starting point is 00:03:52
approximately one gram of protein per pound of body weight. Now, when one strives to do that, it's important to maximize the quality of that protein intake to the calorie ratio, because you don't want to consume an excess of calories when trying to get that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Maui Newi Venison has an extremely high quality protein to calorie ratio, so it makes getting that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight extremely easy. It's also delicious.
Starting point is 00:04:18
Personally, I like the ground venison, I also like the venison steaks, and then for convenience, when I'm on the road, I like the jerky. The jerky is a very high protein to calorie ratio, so it has as much as 10 grams of protein per jerky stick, and it has something like only like 55 calories. So again, making it very easy to get enough protein without consuming excess calories. If you would like to try Maui Newi venison, you can go to MauiNewiVenison.com slash huberman.

AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee, but is in fact a much better way to make coffee. I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago and I've been using one ever since. AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler, who was an engineer at Stanford. And I knew of Alan because he had also built the so-called aerobie frisbee, which I believe
Starting point is 00:05:14
at one time. Perhaps still now held the Guinness Book of World Records for this thrown object. And I used to see Alan, believe it or not, at parks around Palo Alto, testing out different aerobie frisbee. So he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering that turned into commercial products. Now, I love coffee. I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day, usually about 90 to 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning, although not always.
Starting point is 00:05:40
Sometimes if I'm going to exercise, I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning, but I love, love, love coffee. And what I've personally found is that by using the AeroPress, I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee. I don't know what exactly it is in the AeroPress that allows the same beans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee, even the traditional French press.
Starting point is 00:06:06
The AeroPress is extremely easy to use and it's extremely compact. In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel and I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes. I'll just ask for some hot water and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane. If you'd like to try AeroPress, you can go to Aeropress.com slash Huberman.

makes Smart mattress covers with cooling heating heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. Now, a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1-3 degrees. And in order to wake up, feeling refreshed, and energized, your body temperature actually has to drop by about 1-3 degrees. In order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1-3 degrees. One of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate
Starting point is 00:07:13
times, at the beginning and throughout, and at the end of your night when you wake up, is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. That's what 8-Sleep allows you to do. It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized. I've been sleeping on an 8-Sleep mattress cover for almost three years now and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep.

Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman. And now for my discussion with David Goggins. David Goggins, welcome. My man. Do you see you get it, man?
Starting point is 00:08:01
Great to see you. It was late 2016, early 2017, I believe, when you were in my lab at Stanford. Yes, sir. We did a little work later that day down in San Jose and gosh, see you everywhere, but it's not enough. So great to have you here. Thanks for having me, Albro.
Starting point is 00:08:17
Yeah. You embody discipline and doing hard things. Right. I think she just start right off with the bold truth. The bold truth. But right before we went hop mics, we were talking about learning. Right.
Starting point is 00:08:34
Right now you're spending some time learning and doing things that I think most people probably don't typically associate David Goggins with. Right. And why don't you tell us about that? Well most people just look at me as the guy that runs and yells as he's running. And that's, while I do that, you know, to motivate people, but people don't understand that my day is broken up into segments.
Starting point is 00:08:56
I work out, I eat, I sleep, I spend most of my time studying. So like, I'm in the medical world. I'm, you know, paramedic in, in, in I'm Canada, but I spent a lot of my time trying to nuke every single thing about it because I'm not trying to just be a paramedic, learn about veins and arteries and how the heart pumps and stuff like that. I'm trying to learn to the point where I can say someone's life. And even though paramedics are doing that all over the world, I'm
Starting point is 00:09:24
trying to be that paramedic that can really dissect exactly what's going on and figure out, what medication goes where, just trying to learn the algorithm of what's going on, man. So I spend a lot of time with it. I love the word algorithm, because when I teach biology or try and learn anything, that's related to biology, especially the human body.
Starting point is 00:09:45
I need to know the nouns, but it's the verbs that matter. And that's really what you're talking about. Like, just saying that sits there, that brain part there doesn't tell you how it all works together. So what is your process for studying look like? Like if we dropped a camera in the room, but a microphone into your, into your inner dialogue.
Starting point is 00:10:05
Right. Gosh, wouldn't we all love that? But if we dropped a microphone into your inner dialogue, are you waking up looking at the books and going, yeah, fresh day, let's learn. Or is some of the same resistance that you've talked about coming up around physical work? Is that coming up from time to time? You know what? I was nervous at first.
Starting point is 00:10:24
I'm going to keep it real. I'm going was nervous at first. I'm gonna keep the mother I'm gonna keep it real. I'm gonna keep it real. So I'm not a real smart guy and what I mean by that is I was born at 80 80 HD all like my brain cannot retain information I'm not some genetic frequent and comes to run even it comes to lift the waist I am absolutely the bottom of the barrel and when it comes to running, when it comes to lifting weights, I am absolutely the bottom of the barrel. And people will never believe me.
Starting point is 00:10:47
And they can just, you know, whatever, believe what you want to believe. So we asked this question about what does studying look like for me? I have to go over the same page, over and over and over again. While Jennifer can look at that page, while she's, you know, quizzing me,
Starting point is 00:11:07
she'll learn it, right? Then as she's chilling on anything about it, she will quiz herself or quiz me and learn it as she's quizzing me. It's the most frustrating thing in the world, how my brain works. So what I do is I literally sit there with a pen and paper and I have my books and I go through,
Starting point is 00:11:26
I have to write everything down every single day. I will study the same page until it's photographic memory from writing the same thing down. And then from there I'll go back through it and we learn again. So I'll learn the bulk of it, but then I'll go through and learn the small things within that.
Starting point is 00:11:50
So if it's a medication, I'll learn what the medication does. I'll first, I'll learn how to even say the medication because these medications aren't like, you know, like outputable. No, it's very big work. So I'll go through, learn how to say the name. Then I'll go through, learn what the dose is.
Starting point is 00:12:08
Then I'll go through, and it's like every single day. It's not like, oh, I got it. Let's just go through, no, nothing is, I got it. Every single thing, so I can't wait to get in this conversation because everything I do in life, it sucks. Everything I do in life, it sucks. Everything I do in life, it sucks. That's why when I was 300 pounds and 24 years old, it went like I had some big epiphany
Starting point is 00:12:33
of let's just go be a Navy seal. Let's lose some weight. No, I knew my entire life was gonna be a struggle, which is why I just ignored it. And I said, I'm not even trying to jump off into this shit and learn how to read, how to write, how to memorize, how to become something I am not. But through that process, something happened to me. And I realized, this is why I feel sorry for no one. In this podcast, they're going to really not like me
Starting point is 00:13:05
because people are going to think that I am maybe lying or maybe fibbing or exaggerating. No, I am literally, I was the lowest form on earth, no talent, no ability to learn, and I literally know what it is to be rock bottom and to build that up. So that question about learning is the pain in my ass and I don't have to do it. It's the thing about it. I'm 49 years old and I'm a multi-millionaire.
Starting point is 00:13:35
I don't have to do anything. So all I thought about when I was growing up is, man, I can't wait to one day get to the point where I no longer have to do this stuff. But what happens, I got older, it became a way of living. So how I do every day, it's how I do every day. It's a discipline, it's a regiment, it's a, it was a choice I made. And the choice I made was, what are you willing to sacrifice? And what are you willing to give up to find every bit
Starting point is 00:14:08
of who you are as a human being? And I was willing to give everything to do that. So studying is no joke. I love that you're studying. I recall a few years ago, I heard somebody in a review or podcast with you and you just throughout, I don't know what I'll do next. Maybe I'll be a scientist, and I went, yeah. I was like what I'll do next maybe I'll be a scientist and I went yeah
Starting point is 00:14:25
I was like because I knew because I know you a bit and I see your work out there but we'd met before that if you decided that you were gonna do it right and learning Medicine which is what you're doing right learning human physiology is so detailed and people Out there I've to understand when you look at a textbook and you see the veins and the capillaries, different colors, when the body's open, they're not different colors. Right, right, right. So, I mean, some things have different color contrast,
Starting point is 00:14:55
but it's not like it's all labeled when you pop it open. Exactly. And so, the process of writing things down by hand is important for you. So you go back and read those notes. Do you think about that stuff on your runs, too, or are you segmenting your day like when you're done studying? Are you heading out for a run and thinking about other things?
Starting point is 00:15:12
Or are you still rehearsing the material in your head? So when I write it down, I write it down and I'm able to, I'm actually looking down at this table right now because I'm back to write. And so I'm actually there right now. As I'm speaking to you, I write it down in a way that I'm able to, I'm actually looking down at this table right now because I'm back to writing, so I'm actually there right now as I'm speaking to you. I write it down in a way that I'm memorizing page 69. So I'm writing it down so then writing it down and that page sink together in my brain.
Starting point is 00:15:38
So I'm looking at the book in my brain right now. So like, that's just how it works for me. And I have to do it over and over again. So that page is stuck in my brain right now. So like, that's just how it works for me. And I have to do it over and over again. So that page is stuck in my mind. So I'm literally flipping through pages as I'm taking these tests, and I'm taking these national tests to become a paramedic or become a advanced EMT or whatever.
Starting point is 00:15:57
I'm literally as I'm taking that test, I'm going through and I'm like, now I'm flipping pages in my head where that page was and how I do that is just from, how I write it and how it's on the page. When I run, I can't recall any of it. I cannot bring any of that because I'm running. How my mind is wired now is that everything I do
Starting point is 00:16:23
is what I do. Because the focus it takes for me to, like right now, I'm running, I'm not like a great runner. I'm not like injury free. So like my first 20 minutes of the run, I'm limping. I'm literally limping because I've had several knee surgeries and my body was twisted and so now it's untwisting. So people looking, oh, it looks like he's limp,
Starting point is 00:16:47
you know, like limp and when he runs, I am limp and when I run. My body's jacked up so I'm focusing on how to get the best I've a broken body. So everything I do is a total focus on what I'm doing at that point in my life. So it seems like you've really trained away or somehow gotten away from the ADD that you mentioned
Starting point is 00:17:08
because what you described is a deep trench, like a V-shaped trench. I'm imagining like there's a ball bearing and it's like and it can only go forward in that trench. Or back and it goes forward. It's not like sliding around at the like concave at the bottom. Like attention.
Starting point is 00:17:24
So it's like you've trained that up. Is there a similar feeling when you're in the full focus of running versus full focus of studying? Is it kind of feel like, oh yeah, that's the same groove, but different thing? Or is it just completely different world? It's a completely different world. Like it's just both of them for me is suffering,
Starting point is 00:17:43
but suffering a whole different way. Like when I was going through school, I never forget, I think I was in third grade. And back then, ADD, ADHD, what like, here's this medicine, here's this thing, they want to put you in a special school. So for me, I was so far behind in learning that their big thing was, less
Starting point is 00:18:06
this put him in a special school because he'll never learn. And through that process of like, I don't want to be in a special school. I don't want to be treated any differently. It really like I never took medication. I've never taken medication for this. That's right now. You see me looking right in your eyes. What the hell is, you know, it's true, I'm insane right now. And that's why I don't feel bad for people who have ADHD, who have learned disabilities. And some are impossible because you just can't.
Starting point is 00:18:39
Well, a lot of them you can. And but people don't wanna go through the process of focus, of teaching yourself how to truly focus. and but people don't want to go through the process of focus, of teaching yourself how to truly focus. This is where my message gets lost. It gets lost because I may say, you know, MF or F, you know, I may be because that's the passion that comes out of me because it takes everything for me to learn a sentence.
Starting point is 00:19:02
So when I speak about David Goggins, I can't speak about David Goggins in a way that's just common cool. Because when I wake up, I know the journey that takes for me to find my greatness, and it's hard. Everything, nothing is easy. Nothing is just like, oh, I wake up and I just do this, or I do that, or it just, you know, I watch people every day go through life and it's so easy. I do that or it just, you know, I watch people every day go through life and it's so easy. For me to be where I'm at today, it takes every bit of me.
Starting point is 00:19:30
So when I speak about it, and I like, go on here, you'll start seeing me the temple will rise, the passion will come out because I'm back there. I'm doing what I do every day to become a human being. And so nothing is easy. Like running is running. It sucks, but you have a choice to make.
Starting point is 00:19:48
Do you want to sit down and go back to that guy you once were? No. So this is what it takes. This is what it takes that misunderstanding of people and they'll never get it because they've never never David Goggins. So that is what it takes for me to do what I do. It may take you something differently. So for me, everything has to be in the study and everything
Starting point is 00:20:08
has to be into this. Everything has to be in everywhere I am has to be there. Me focus where I am. That's why you're my second podcast. I've done this. This Rogan says the book came out. I don't have time for that shit. Because if I want to be great, I'm not trying to maximize money or maximize people knowing me. I do these things because maybe someone out there will understand me and get it and say, I can grow from this guy and others just won't.
Starting point is 00:20:35
Sounds like friction is something you're very familiar with. I just, it's the word just as I feel like is like, yes, cast above us right now in bold space, highlighted underline letters. Friction is friction. Yes. Like you're you're up in the morning and I imagine David Goggins going to the coffee maker stretching out good morning sunshine
Starting point is 00:20:53
and you're telling me from eyelids open. Mm-hmm. There's friction. Yes. And that is the thing that people don't, they don't fucking get. The biggest misunderstanding about David got guys of all time. It's like whether you believe in God or not, I do. He put this lab rat, which is me, on this planet. It's let me fucking see what a beat up abused kid
Starting point is 00:21:20
who can barely learn, barely learn, who has a twisted body, messed up genetics, sickle cell, this and that. Let me give him everything that pretty much disqualifies you from the military. But back then, it wasn't extras. And let's put them in this and see what comes out of it. So to do that, friction, you don't wake up in the morning time
Starting point is 00:21:44
and go to the coffee maker. In fact,, you don't wake up in the morning time and go to the coffee maker. In fact, sometimes you don't even sleep. What it requires is when I met two o'clock in the morning, and my brain is thinking about a fucking drug, and I gotta get up and look in my book to see if that drug is how I remember it. And this is every day of my fucking life. That's when I train a fighter or I train. So I'm like,
Starting point is 00:22:07
you have no fucking idea how great you really are because you are using such minimal, minimal of what you have. And if people can learn to focus, this was possible while it may not be pretty. Like people who want to do a documentary on me, I go, no. Like people who want to do a documentary on me. I go, no. I always do a documentary on me. Because I will have normal everyday people picking me apart on his life as miserable. Who wants to live like that?
Starting point is 00:22:37
He looks, it's crazy how he's, someone's like he's sick, he's psychotic. The most frustrating thing in the world for me is when normal people judge a man like myself, on what it really takes to extract greatness from nothing. It takes every bit of who you are. If you choose that route, if you don't,
Starting point is 00:23:04
Merry Christmas, do what you to do. But yeah, all these things for me, like I told you, I'm going to keep it real. I'm not coming here to talk about like, you know, perform without purpose. Because I go through, when I write these books, I go through and try to dumb down David goddess. How can I give normal people, and I'm normal, but I found something that most don't want to find. How can I speak to people and give them something from this crazy, psychotic brain that I've developed? How can I give them that?
Starting point is 00:23:38
So I sit down with Jennifer for years and write down, performed out purpose, callous your mind, armor your mind, the cookie jar, the account of billionaire, shit that people can fucking use in their lives. No, no, I'm glad it helps you. But the barbaric life that I live, that you have to live, the almost obsession
Starting point is 00:24:04
that you must have to be great. You can't put that shit in the fucking book, bro. You can't put in a book. You can't. You can't write about it. It has to be experienced. It has to be experienced. And you can't even, after you experience it, to write it in a book, it would seem like
Starting point is 00:24:22
it needs to be locked up. This way. It is too gory. It's too gory to make sense for a guy that everything, every second of the day, he is trying to extract more from something. He's constantly thinking, he's constantly disciplined, never going off the path. Whatever is injured on him, he figures away.
Starting point is 00:24:43
It's a conqueror's mindset. And very few people of any can really understand what that is. Like, I'm almost 50, and I've been this way for almost 30 years. Like, what do you do for fun? You would never, like, these questions, I don't get them. I don't understand them. I don't understand them. I don't, so yeah. I get asked that sometimes,
Starting point is 00:25:08
what do you for fun? I start listening off all the stuff like podcast and reading, working out. But, so some of that resonates, but I think what's so truly unusual about what you're describing, your process, is that from go, it's hard. And I have to ask was being 300 pounds,
Starting point is 00:25:28
having a cent, I'm using the words you described, you've said it before, you had a tendency at one point in your life early on, tell lies, try and get people's approval. Vama, ass off. Crazy haircuts, attention seeking, and yet all of that triggered something. That now is extraordinary.
Starting point is 00:25:53
Do you think those hardships were necessary to flip the switch? I don't know if they were necessary, but it was something that made me feel, I didn't feel good. It was easy. The brain that I was given as a child, it was easy to go home and think about what, how do I want to be a freak today? How do I want to show up to school today and be a freak?
Starting point is 00:26:19
It didn't require me going home and opening a book up, saying, it's gonna take me all year to learn this fucking page. So instead of learning that page, I learned how to become a character. And maybe that character that I created that 300 pound insecure guy that used to fake it time, make it type of guy, you know, let me become your friend. Let me lie to you until you like me type of guy.
Starting point is 00:26:48
When you have any kind of, any manhood, womanhood, a human being, a soul, a spirit, any, I had no, I must have just this much pride, because that's exactly what opened the door for me. Because every day you were a. Because every day you were a character, every day you were a clown, every day you opened that Spanish book or that science book or English book and you like you looked at it, it looked like a foreign language.
Starting point is 00:27:17
And you're sitting, where do I start? Where do I start? And obviously it wasn't necessary. The more I talk about it, it wasn't necessary. Because what happened is I became haunted by the mere fact that this is my existence. And you got to live with that. Now, live with it for a lot of years. And so I sat back and said, okay, all right, I know what this takes. And when you sit back as fucked up as I was and I had a laundry list, a table like this of what I have to do to become just a human being that can make ends meet, that can make a thousand dollars a month just to get there.
Starting point is 00:28:00
Was like, oh my God, dude, like how the, I'm 16, 17, I can't read, I can't write. And I, oh my God, I'm so behind the power curve and my brain is about being depressed and my dad beat my mom's not home and kids are calling me nigger at school and I'm like, oh my God, man, what the fuck do I do? And when someone came around and said, hey man, you can do this. This is all me.
Starting point is 00:28:29
So people know, where is this cold man come from? I'm not trying to be cold. It's the reality of my life. It's the reality of a lot of people's lives. And so, yeah, that had to happen for me to be haunted, to be haunted, to pull out, to extract the guy in the day. That haunting is something that's still there today, because no matter how much you improve, no matter how much you change who you are, it's not permanent.
Starting point is 00:28:59
You just wake up and say, oh my God, man, you're, you're David Goggins, you break records, you do this, you do that. People don't know, how are you able to just be so hard because I never turned the fucking thing off? Because once it turns off, I go right back to the David Goggins that is. And that's the guy that I'm constantly fighting every day. And it's a choice.
Starting point is 00:29:25
And that choice makes you misunderstood, it makes you crazy. That's why I hate fucking social media. In 2013, people wanted me to write my book, I did it in 2018, took five years. And the reason why I didn't do it, I sent a table in Jennifer was there, this before I, she started working for me.
Starting point is 00:29:45
I started dating or whatever. And all these people were there and they're like, man, you gotta go on social media. And I was like, fuck you, man. Like, I'm not, that's, it's poison. It's poison because I knew what I did to get where I am. And I'm gonna have these people, these normal everyday people. Fat, lazy, it's exactly who I was judging me.
Starting point is 00:30:11
Cause I know it, cause I was once them. All my hard work, all my dedication, I'm gonna have so normal dude, get his little brownies, little ding dong, ho ho twinky, sit there with this coffee, picking me apart. Oh, he must be unhappy. He's just, you know, how hard is to put these shoes
Starting point is 00:30:30
on every day of morning? I don't have you pick me apart. So, yeah, there's so much that goes into this that I was like, fuck this. I never want anything to do with it. So, anyway. I'm not a psychologist, but knowing your story from what you've written, what you've said on social media, now it's a podcast, and here now especially.
Starting point is 00:30:58
It's amazing to me. And frankly, it pulls at my heartstrings a little bit. I realize that's not what you're trying to do, but that in the course of your childhood and in your young adulthood, that no one ever got between you and the world. I forget where I heard it that, like if a kid has just one person that believes in them,
Starting point is 00:31:15
you know, and I had my trials and tribulations, but I had great coaches, great mentors. I attached to them. I found them if they didn't necessarily find me. But I'm realizing that your situation was, no one's ever said, hey, I'm gonna stand here next to you or get in front of you, put a shield up. And so it's almost like you've got these different,
Starting point is 00:31:38
it's all you, but there's versions of yourself that like you knew social media, like I don't know that I have the wherewithal in 2013, 14, 15, 16, 17 to get in front of myself while doing all this because I've already got so much going on in here. Is that about right? That is right, but I had developed a lot of anger and I still have it and it would never go away for the normal human beings in this world. Because when you put yourself in the sewer like I was in, and please, if someone saved me, come out
Starting point is 00:32:10
and announce it to the world, there's no one. There's no one. So when you know that, and then I'm sitting at a table with all these smart people, or tell me what to do and shit and guiding me through my life now, when I'm 40 fucking years old, with all these smart people were telling me what to do and shit and guided me through my life now when I'm 40 fucking years old you know I was I don't know 40 something years on now I'm 49
Starting point is 00:32:35
and I'm looking at them all and they're now trying to guide me on which right on this poison and so yeah what you say is right but but for me, it was more of, I know now. I don't need you to guide my future. I know what's good for me. It was bad for me. And for me, it took every bit of focus I could. I know social media. I saw people love to go on there because they want to show you the good side of life. I'm not teaching good side of life. So I had to figure out a way when I came on through in 2016 of teaching you what life really is for the majority of us as hell. And so while people love to show you the cars and the house and the vacations and shit,
Starting point is 00:33:24
all that's good, all that's happy. I'm gonna show you the side that I know most of you're going through. And people hide very well. I don't wanna hide anymore. I hit it for 24 fucking years. That's why now I told you, we can talk about it whatever you want. Because as human beings, the first thing we have to learn, I also studied real bad growing up.
Starting point is 00:33:48
So if you hear me study every now and then, it's because that was part of my life also. So it's funny, human beings wanna show you the best side and they wanna hide the worst side. For me, I'm gonna teach you how to be vulnerable. Because that's the only way you fix yourself. You don't fix yourself. I come out here and me selling you some fucking books.
Starting point is 00:34:09
That's why I don't have them. I forgot them. I'm glad people got something from the book. I want you to learn that the only way you grow is how to look at yourself and say, okay, like I did. Table longer than this, what the fuck I have to do to get somewhere. There was nothing good on there.
Starting point is 00:34:32
Nothing, yeah, I love playing basketball, I left that out, I love to do. I don't care about that, that's it, make the fucking list. Cause the list that I had to live by was the very list that was to get me at this table with you. To talk to you to the normal human beings was I once was about how you can get somewhere and how it looks.
Starting point is 00:34:56
Looks very ugly. There's no fucking passion, no fucking motivation. There's no, oh my God, man, I fucking, this is, no. It's every day of your life just doing. No passion, no discipline, no motivation. All these words, I hate people, I hate, that's so many people fucking use these words now because it's watered.
Starting point is 00:35:19
It's someone sitting in the room by themselves and they figure themselves out and say, God, this is gonna fucking suck. Where's passion when you're 300 pounds? Where's the motivation when you can't read and write? Where is it? So how did this happen? I just fucking did. I just did. I said, maybe at the end of this journey, there'll be something there for me.
Starting point is 00:35:43
If not, I can read. If not, I'm 185 fucking pounds. There's no magic potion. There's no, oh, let me wake up and look at some shit. No. All those words are overused. They're bullshit. It's all bullshit. Just do. You're living. How do you want to live? How do you want to die? How do you want to fucking be remembered? That's it. That's it.
Starting point is 00:36:12
Period. As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes I simply can't get
Starting point is 00:36:33
enough servings. But with AGE1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need, and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1. I have more focus and energy and I sleep better and it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take just one supplement, what would it be? I answer AG1. If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com slash huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2. Again, that's drink AG1.com Sash Huberman. The word haunted is ringing in my head. Yep.
Starting point is 00:37:14
I think it's such a powerful word. Yep. Because I was about to say, it seems like a huge part of your process, maybe the entire process is it's all stick, no carrot. You know, you talk about the carrot, the positive thing, and then there's the stick, the thing you're trying to avoid. I feel like it's, the way it's landing for me is it's all stick and gas pedal. Is it? There's no carrot. You're not imagining, oh, when I'm a paramedic,
Starting point is 00:37:44
when the book is published, and obviously you set those goals And you make those targets, but it's all stick. All stick No carrot think about that I'm waking up right now studying like I have a test tomorrow All right past the fucking test Think about that everyday in my life That's what I must do just to retain what I learned. Four hours plus a day, I go through and do that. There's no stick or there's only
Starting point is 00:38:15
a stick. There's never been a carrot. Which is why when I speak to people, I have to figure out a way to resonate with them. Cause all I wanna say to them is, let me teach you the real life, how it really is. The reason why you're a loser, and the reason why you're not fucking making it, and the reason why you're trying to go to all these, I go to all these fucking conventions,
Starting point is 00:38:42
speak all the fucking time. I look into fucking the audience and these people sign up, sign up, sign up. Fucking every year to go to convention. Thinking they're gonna learn something, fucking different. No, you're lazy. You know exactly what to do. Exactly what to do.
Starting point is 00:38:59
Cause even me, in my state of, I can't read and write. I knew exactly what to do. It just sucks doing it. It sucks to do it. It sucks to wake up every morning of your life and say, God, man, I'm not smart. So guess what I gotta do? I gotta study the same shit that I get
Starting point is 00:39:21
one of the highest scores in the nation on. And do it again, do it again, do it again. It's not just there, it's not just there permanently for me. So yeah, it's all stick, it's all stick. The only character you have is like, maybe, maybe, because whenever I take these tests they're real hard. And back in my brain is like the good chance you're not gonna make it y'all can
Starting point is 00:39:50
This ain't you bro This ain't you you weren't born like this This ain't you the real you bro study all you want you but the second that fucking computer comes on with 150 questions This ain't you man computer comes on with 150 questions? It's saying it's you, man. And somehow comes back, I passed. I passed again, passed again. But that rule of me back here every fucking time, it's saying, that ain't you, bro.
Starting point is 00:40:18
That ain't you. And I have to outwork that voice. When I'm taking that test and I get to a question, I don't fucking know the answer. I'm like, fuck, man. And then, say, I told you, man, that ain't you. You 300 pounds, man, you said to a homie, you forgot how to do your hair.
Starting point is 00:40:37
That's what you do, how to come to school with the reverse baldness when you're 16. That's you. So, there is no good idea of free card. This is why I say stay hard. Because when you weren't given the gifts, the only thing you can do in life is stay hard. And I know people cannot stand me.
Starting point is 00:41:00
They can't stand this talk. This is all you can do. There's no magic pill or a magic potion. All you can do is out work the man that God created or woman in you. And what that looks like is unfun. That's why I said do not do a documentary on me. Because people will not see the truth. They will see what they want to see.
Starting point is 00:41:29
I don't want to live like that. Good. Good. And you will live exactly the way you live now. Questioning who you are. Wondering what is possible. Wondering what you are capable of doing. That's how that looks.
Starting point is 00:41:44
Or you can be me, What's in my happy? I don't know never thought about it. Don't really care about it because all I really cared about was when I looked in that fucking mirror I saw a piece of shit Happiness wasn't on the mirror at 16 Around 300 pounds. It wasn't like oh, I'm looking for happiness. No, I'm looking looking myself in the mirror I said all right, motherfucker, you did it again today. You're a bad boy, because that shit sucks. I have about a couple of minutes of that, right?
Starting point is 00:42:14
Got the carrot. Second, lay down and go to bed, the carrot's gone, because I'm waking up all through the night to check the work I did that day. That I get this drug right, that I get this right, that I did that day. That get this drug right, that get this right, that get that right. What I do, oh my God, fuck, I'm already losing it. Stick.
Starting point is 00:42:35
That stick haunting you. Honding. It's following you around. So no picture of Jordan on the wall, you're not listening to YouTube inspiration video. That would be all your voice anyway. You're not listening to your top 10 favorite songs just to get rolling and then lace the shoes,
Starting point is 00:42:53
hit the books. It's all in here. Oh, I used to do that when I was fat. Rocky, let me know, that was my thing. Round 14 was my thing. And as I got older and older and older, that started to go away. And I started to create all these people
Starting point is 00:43:14
that I used to watch. Rocky was one Barnes Elias from Patoon. Jack from a few good men. You know, he's on the stand going crazy. I saw a lot of these characters that I looked at and I was like, man, I ain't got none of that. But they were characters. After a while, I lived a life so disciplined that everybody that I once looked to, these
Starting point is 00:43:41
fake characters, I built that as a man. And when I was younger, I had this image in my mind of what does a man look like to me? And I got all these people who were bad-assed characters. And in my mind, I became that. And that's what kept me going a lot. Because I had this pipe dream of becoming a little bit of this and a little bit of that. And that's what kept me going a lot. Was I had this pipe dream of becoming a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
Starting point is 00:44:08
Because when you have no parents raising you and you have no role models growing up, you, it's not daydreaming. You start to create a reality that, maybe I can be that. And after becoming this guy, that is the biggest thing I can ever do in my life is I became that guy that I once looked at all these guys and I look at myself like,
Starting point is 00:44:38
God, who the fuck can do that? I can, but what it takes is a discipline that no one can ever even, they don't understand it. They don't understand it. Everybody has their abilities. Do it, but they just don't want to. They want to keep asking questions and keep going to seminars.
Starting point is 00:44:58
And the greatness is right in you. That's why once again, I'll say some million times here. I do not feel sorry for you. I will not sugarcoat what I'm going to say to you because all of you know what I'm saying is the truth. Everybody knows the truth. This is what it looks like and you know it too. You know it too. If you ain't got nothing, I hate to tell you what it looks like is ugly.
Starting point is 00:45:22
It's not a documentary. It's not an HBO special. You ain't got Washington. Hey man, you guys got watched this. No, it's like, oh god. This looks like a train wreck. It's not a documentary, it's not an HBO special. You ain't gonna watch it, but hey, man, you guys got to watch this. No, it's like, oh, God, this looks like a train wreck. It's like a nightmare. This looks like this guy got, no, so it looks like hard work. Looks horrible. It's not motivating.
Starting point is 00:45:36
It's not motivating at all. Ain't like Rocky Round 14, we get knocked down and you can do that this to a polycrete. It looks like a man being stuck in a fucking dungeon and there's no fucking way out. But you had the fucking key. But you refused to use it. And that's not motivating about that.
Starting point is 00:45:57
So yes, no document on David Goggins. The real life. David Goggins is the documentary. It's all, it's already being written. You real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life.
Starting point is 00:46:09
The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life.
Starting point is 00:46:17
The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life.

The real life. The real life. The real life. The real life. The it's a name, it doesn't mean anything. We could call it the cookie monster.
Starting point is 00:46:26
Right. But what's interesting about this brain area is there are now a lot of data in humans, not some mouse study, showing that when people do something, they don't wanna do, like add three hours of exercise per day or per week, or when people who are trying to diet and lose weight resist eating something. When people do anything that they, and this is the important part, that they don't want to do, it's not about adding more work, it's about adding more work that you don't want to do.
Starting point is 00:46:58
This brain area gets bigger. Now here's what's especially interesting about this brain area to me, and by the way, I'm only learning this recently because it's new data, but there's a lot of it. The anterior mid-singulate cortex is smaller and obese people. It gets bigger when they die. It's larger in athletes. It's especially large or grows larger in people that see themselves as challenge and overcome some challenge.
Starting point is 00:47:31
And in people that live a very long time, this area keeps its size. In many ways, scientists are starting to think of the enter mid-singulate cortex not just as one of the seats of willpower, but perhaps Actually the seat of the will to live Now we're talking and when I learned about the enter mid-singulate cortex I was like almost out of my seat and I've been in the neuroscience games since I was 20 We're the same age and I was so pumped because I've heard of the amygdala fear prefrontal cortex It's planning an action. I could tell you every brain area and every,
Starting point is 00:48:07
I teach neuroanatomy to medical students, but when I started seeing the data on the anterior mid-singulate cortex, I was like, whoa, this is interesting. And all the data points to the fact that we can build this area up, but that as quickly as we build it up, if we don't continue to invest in things
Starting point is 00:48:27
that are hard for us, that we don't want to do, that's the part that feels so goggin'-esque to me, that we don't want to do. Like if you love the ice bath, yeah, I love the ice bath and you go from one minute to 10 minutes, guess what, your anterior midsignulate cortex did not grow. But if you hate the cold water, if you're afraid of drowning, and you get into water and put your head under,
Starting point is 00:48:51
then your anterior mids and survive, then the anterior midsingulate cortex gets bigger. But if you don't do it the next day, or if you do it the next day and you enjoy it, because hey, hey, I did it yesterday. Woohoo! Happy me, Merry Christmas, is that? Merry Christmas. Guess what?
Starting point is 00:49:07
The anterior mid-singulate cortex shrinks again. Yep. To me, this is one of the most important discoveries that neuroscience has ever made. Because it's that I don't want to do something, but do it anyway. That's right. That grows this area.
Starting point is 00:49:21
And it's almost like I have a friend. He's been sober 30 years from alcohol. And he always says, you know, the amazing thing about addiction is there's a cure. The problem is it only works one day at a time. And so you have to renew it every day. So the answer mid-singulate cortex to me when I learned about it, two things went off in my head. Whoa, this is super interesting. And two, I got to tell David Goggins about this. And I waited until now to tell you, because I felt like, well, for obvious reasons, I wanted to tell you and I wanted to tell you here.
Starting point is 00:49:51
Well, I love that because that's how I live my entire life. I don't know anything about that. But people will make you have such a strong will. It's something that you build. Like I never forgot, I was on a podcast one time, and this dude goes, you were blessed with a strong mind. Like the hell you talking about, it's blessed with a strong mind,
Starting point is 00:50:16
that's something that you have to develop. You develop that over years, decades of suffering and going back into the suffer That's why a lot of people who graduate Navy seal training they will know but in my I Talk about very openly all the time A lot of guys don't go don't want to go back into that water Don't want to go back into the hard stuff. It may be not anything hard, anything hard in life.
Starting point is 00:50:48
Once you get through it, it's like you become a P.O.W. Like how many P.O.W.s you know want to go back to P.O.W. camp? None. When something sucks so bad in life, this is on this that we're talking about now. Very few people want to go back. They're happy they graduated. I realized, I'm the same way, I don't want to go back.
Starting point is 00:51:14
I have to go back. I must go back because that is exactly where all the knowledge of my life exists, was back there in which you exactly be talking about. Well, I didn't know anything about this, but how I grew a will was constantly doing these things. To now, it's just life. I wake up while I still suck, it's just life.
Starting point is 00:51:40
You don't sit back and like, oh my God, like, I have days I don't wanna do, but I know I'm gonna do it. I know from years of just doing it. So that's beautiful. And this is why I came on here with you today. And I'm glad that you're talking about this because human beings need to hear this. Then he stopped hearing these hacks on this and that.
Starting point is 00:52:03
There's no fucking hack, bro. There's no fucking hack. Yeah, you may this and that and saunas and all this shit that they, yeah, it's great. There is no fucking life hack to grow that thing. How do you grow it? Do it and do it and do it and do it. That's the hack. The hack is gonna fucking suck. And that's what I realized. That's what I realized. Life, that's why I wanted to come on here today. I didn't even come on here and talk about no fucking
Starting point is 00:52:33
passion and purpose and how to get the fuck out of bed and how to hit a fucking alarm clock and all this catchphrase bullshit. Cause that wasn't how I lived. I went how I lived. I lived, I woke up like every human being does and goes, fuck man, I'm a fucking piece of shit today. How the hell is this gonna work out for me? And you fight that.
Starting point is 00:52:55
And you fight that, you don't override it. No override button. It's the conversation in your fucking, in your head. So how do you do that? We don't have enough of these conversations about the real conversation that every human being is having and they have no idea how to get out of it, but they do. Is that shit right there, man?
Starting point is 00:53:16
Yeah, build your will. How do you build your will? Is that what you said, man? Is that what you said? Well, I feel like knowing the name of something anterior mid-singulate cortex doesn't fundamentally change us, but one thing I like about biology is that willpower, if somebody feels they don't have it,
Starting point is 00:53:36
feels like this thing that other people have, but everybody, unless they're brain-damaged, like a hole through their head has two anterior mid-singulate cortex, one on each side of their brain. Everyone has one. They have two. So I feel like it's just a question of opening the portal. And the portal, what I, again, I've been saying 10 times
Starting point is 00:53:59
and forgive me is I think people go, oh, I do hard things. I do sets to failure and then I do four steps. I love training with weights. I love doing sets to failure. I even like four steps, but guess what? I like four steps, so I'll tell you, they don't build my anterior mid-singulate cortex.
Starting point is 00:54:14
Because I like to do it. Anything you like to do is not gonna enhance this aspect of willpower. And it seems so obvious once you hear it, you kinda go, oh yeah, of course, but I think you really close that loop for people when you share what you're sharing today and what you've shared elsewhere before as well when you're trying to explain the friction is the critical ingredient. And I think people think, oh, if it's effort, well, then I'm
Starting point is 00:54:41
getting better. That's part of it necessary, but not sufficient, as we say in science. But the suck part, the haunt, being haunted, the stick, they're really unpleasant terms. It's probably the most unpleasant terms we've ever used on this podcast. Those are the, those are the levers. Those are the gears and without those, this thing that you're talking about, David Goggins as a verb. I sometimes make the joke, but it's not a joke. Goggins is a name, and it's a verb. People go, I'm gonna Goggins that, right? But that's, I think, again, I'm not a psychologist,
Starting point is 00:55:21
but I think that's what you're talking about. The stick, the friction being haunted, it's the sock part that grows this anterior mid-singulate cortex. So now you know why there's so many people that fail in this world to figure out their purpose, their purpose in life. Where do I go? Because to grow that, you may not look like me, how my daily life looks.
Starting point is 00:55:52
Don't look fun. Don't look fun. So it's a choice that people have to make in life. But what's so funny about it is even the richest of rich, who have everything, they always ask me this question I feel like I'm missing something I don't feel like I'm missing shit. I'll have what you all have But you're never in my life hear me tell you I'm missing something and everybody is
Starting point is 00:56:25
to missing this feeling. I found it a long time ago. I found it right there in that willpower thing. When you're nothing, nothing. And change yourself into something like me. You call it happiness, peace, wherever the fuck you wanna call it happiness, peace, where the fuck you wanna call it. People are missing exactly what went on with David Goggins. Why don't you smile?
Starting point is 00:56:52
I do, I do, but I figure something out. That's why I am never, you'll never hear me say, I'm missing something. I found it years ago. You find it in the suck. You find it in the suck. You find it in the suck, and you find it repeatedly in the suck. To the point where you know exactly who you are.
Starting point is 00:57:12
Most people are missing something because they don't know who they are. They never examine themselves. They've never done this experiment on themselves. The lab rat, we're all lab rats, but you're also the scientist. You create your own self. Most people are missing something because there's so much trapped in there. I only want to say potential. I think that's where you just use out too much too. There's so much in you that God or wherever the hell you believe in, or if you're atheist, in you that you have not unlocked, that you walk around with this gorgeous wife or great
Starting point is 00:57:50
husband and all this money, like, God, I feel like I'm missing something. Yeah, because it's about 75% of you is still fucking in there. Still chained up because you just didn't want to find your willpower. Didn't want to find your soul, your will, your heart, your determination, your guts, your courage. And what that looks like, it looks scary, like your little scary lab I went in. Scary to wake up every day and say, I'm stupid, but I want to figure out a way to be smarter. What is it saying, man, I just can't do that. So you limit this box. So your box becomes
Starting point is 00:58:27
so small of things you can do. My box wouldn't even a box. It was a fucking little like little pinhole. And then through examining myself, getting some willpower, some courage, it became bigger in this table. But that's what we all do. That's why I wanted to come here today and talk to you about real shit. Not no fucking like hacks. There's no hacks, bro. It's you against you. You against you. And if you misunderstand that,
Starting point is 00:58:56
you have a real problem. Real problem. I can understand you misunderstand me, running on the street, short off. Fuck this. No, yeah, I can get it. I get it. If you misunderstand what I on the street, short off, fuck this, no, yeah, I can get it, I get it. If you misunderstand what I'm saying right now today,
Starting point is 00:59:09
the problem is you and you don't wanna fix it. Well, the children of wealthy people are a case study in how not having enough friction can destroy a life. True statement. I mean, I could list off prominent names in the press, but those are actually the least interesting, what's probably more interesting as an example is all the ones we don't hear about, because we never hear about them. They just do window and
Starting point is 00:59:36
wither. Or I think there's this big category of people I'm realizing as we have this conversation today, that they're not super successful, they're not struggling. They're like successful enough that they never have to, that you can get to the point where you don't have to impose friction, you even said it. Your bank account is in a place where you don't really need to do all the things you do,
Starting point is 01:00:01
probably not even a small fraction of them. You're not there. Right. But you realize the stick and being haunted is the fuel and the engine. need to do all the things you do, probably not even a small fraction of them. You're not doing that. Right. But you realize the stick and being haunted is the fuel and the engine. And you'd be truly crazy to give that up because you've internalized all that. But most people, they're good enough for them. And so they don't actually want to be better badly enough in order to start going wrong after wrong.
Starting point is 01:00:28
Well, think about when you build real power and think about how much I've built. Now that you know about this, I didn't know about this, but think about how much I've built. Everything I've ever done in my life I didn't want to do. Everything, every day, I'm a lazy piece of shit. And I want the hardest working people to ever step foot on the planet Earth. And I'm saying that very proudly because I know what I do, not cocky.
Starting point is 01:00:55
I'll tell you I'm stupid. And I'll also tell you the exact opposite of what I've done. It's the truth. It is the truth. So imagine how much I've developed in that time frame. But it's the scary thing. Why most people don't want to do that? Build that willpower? It's because of this scary. It unlocks a whole bunch of
Starting point is 01:01:20
things about who you are and who you're not. And a lot of people don't want to go down that journey to discover who they are and who they're not. Because it's not a pretty journey. I mean, I've gone down it. It's not like I went down it once. I go down it all the time. And when you unlock that and you can't just turn it off, like people say, Hey, how can you haven't retired yet? I built all this willpower. Do you think it's good? Let me just retire because my knees hurt. It's telling me every morning, I wake up like, man, I don't, my knees hurt, my legs hurt, my body hurts, but you can still run. So why aren't you running? If you can still run, there'll be a time when you can't lay some up anymore,
Starting point is 01:02:08
but you can still run. So I still run. When the time comes, I can't run, the body will say, you just can't run. But if I can still do something that will power that I have created, it makes me do it every fucking day. And that's what they don't get.
Starting point is 01:02:28
What builds a human being is you start with the small building blocks. And before you know it, man, you become something that you, it doesn't even make sense to most people, because it's just who you are now. That's why I can still run at 50 with broke, at 40 now, with broke down ease and broke down body. Because my body knows you still can, therefore I do. Second, you stop. The real power is gone. And that's beautiful.
Starting point is 01:02:52
I'm so glad you brought that to me because I was wondering, what's this separation thing now? At 24 years old, I started building something that I didn't even know was going to be what it is now at 49. And that's all it was. It was just that. This structure, interimid Singulate Cortex, has inputs and outputs from a bunch of places, but you'll probably not be surprised to learn that it's strongly activated when we move our body when we don't want to move our body.
Starting point is 01:03:23
I feel like it's like the David Goggle structure, right? It is. And it also has strong connections to the dopamine reward pathway. And everyone goes, yeah, dopamine reward. Everyone loves dopamine. I'm partially responsible for people knowing a bit more about dopamine, but dopamine's badly understood.
Starting point is 01:03:41
Everyone thinks dopamine, dopamine hits, it's about reward. It's about understood. Everyone thinks dopamine, dopamine hits, it's about reward. It's about motivation and drive. And there are pain inputs to the dopamine centers of the brain. No one talks about that. Everyone's like, oh, you want the chocolate, you know, chocolate sex, cocaine.
Starting point is 01:03:56
Yeah, that's all true. You released dopamine. Pain releases dopamine. That anti-imid-singulate cortex can trigger the release of dopamine in response to this thing that we're calling friction. And that's a learned thing. That's something that no animal or human being comes into the world. Learning we all are averse to pain and like pleasure, like sugar fat, don't like hot surfaces. But this is a structure that learns.
Starting point is 01:04:28
hot surfaces. But this is a structure that learns. It has neuroplasticity, the ability to change throughout the entire lifespan. And here's the part that I think again is just neuro-nerd speak for what you already know and have done and exemplify is that people say, oh, it has plasticity, you can change it, but guess what, it has plasticity in both directions. It can grow, but just as easily as it can grow, it's like silly putty, it can shrink. Right. So it requires constant upkeep. Right. And that answer isn't one that people are going to like.
Starting point is 01:04:54
Nope. They're like, give me the energy drink, give me the supplement, give me the sauna protocol. That's going to make my anterior mid-singulate cortex. Like someone out there right now is going, wait, if I took transcranial magnetic stimulation and I was stimuli, yeah, you'd probably, actually they've done that.
Starting point is 01:05:08
They've stuck a little wire during neurosurgery into this structure. This is actually discovered by a colleague of mine, Joe Parvizzi. Stimulate and the patients go, I feel like there's a storm coming and they go, oh, is it scary? And they go, no, I want to go through it.
Starting point is 01:05:25
They come off the stimulation and people are like, this is the seat of what we're talking about. Right. Exactly. And it learns. So the fact that you kept this brain structure, I'm convinced if we image your brain it'd be large and it would be larger in two years in a year. But this is the no days off rationale because it can grow and it would be larger in two years in a year. But this is the no days off rationale,
Starting point is 01:05:47
because it can grow and it can shrink. I know. What you're saying right now, I didn't know any of this. And I never, and I always talked to you, but I wish I could just put this on paper and you're saying it in a way that people can understand. I can never put in the words on what I built. And the power that is within all of us. But you put it so like in a scientific way, most people
Starting point is 01:06:14
like for me, he's just crazy. That's why I don't like talking about it, man. I know I'm not crazy. I know what I had to do to get where I had to go. People look at us crazy because they're people that just, if you can't imagine yourself doing something, if you can't imagine yourself doing something, the person that's doing it is crazy. Because in your mind, the logic behind it, it doesn't compute.
Starting point is 01:06:42
Therefore you have to give somebody a title. And a title for me is usually he's crazy, he's this, he's that. No, no. For some reason, me wanting to be somebody so fucking bad in my life, I created that. And I've been trying to figure out years of my life trying to explain to people. But even though you're explaining it now, this is the easy fucking part. Them listening to this shit is the easy fucking part. The part that why there always be the ones of ones is because putting that practice, putting that into actual work No, man. No
Starting point is 01:07:27
No, that's where the demons come in. That's where you like I Don't want to be better. I don't want to be better. This is what it takes to be better. I don't want to be better So everybody's that's why there's a lot of average And it makes me so fucking mad Every day I walk this earth and I see average all over the fucking place. And they wanna ask me, how did you do it? I can't tell you how,
Starting point is 01:07:53
cause you're not gonna fucking, you're not gonna do it. You're not gonna do it. You're gonna continue being out, cause every day you wake up, like he says, like get the coffee, make the pancakes, kiss the girl, kiss the kids. You wake up, write to work. Immediately your mind is in action. No one must do that.
Starting point is 01:08:15
No one. And I don't blame them. But don't be mad. When you're laying there and you're fucking bad and you're in the fucking hospital and you're 70, 89 years old and you're taking, I feel like I didn't fucking do some because you did. You didn't do it. You didn't do shit. You may live a great life, man, but you're always good for empty inside.
Starting point is 01:08:37
I don't feel empty. So call what you want. There's not one empty bone in my fucking body because I have figured out that really the magic potion at least to my life. And it's very rewarding. I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker. Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood NDNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.
Starting point is 01:09:05
I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done. For the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. Now major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do with that information. Withincyte tracker, they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, etc.
Starting point is 01:09:33
But it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition, behavioral modifications, supplements, etc. that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try Inside Tracker, you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman. People like to talk about what they used to be able to do. I hear this a lot.
Starting point is 01:10:00
You should have seen me in high school. I was last. Yep. Okay, got it. And it's not just guys. You should see me working out in high school, I was laugh. Yep. Yeah, okay, got it. And it's not just guys, you should see me working out in high school, I was super fit. People will look back to a time where they felt like they were capable of something and now they're not.
Starting point is 01:10:16
And you kind of want to just grab and wait, that was you then, it's you now. But people tend to think about how the conditions that were around success must have been part of it. And you can understand why. It's like, it's very rational. I was in that situation. I was successful. I'm in this situation. I'm not. That was the past. This is the present. Ergo capable, right? You see how people get into these loops. And as you mentioned, you spend the first 20 years of your life in an extremely challenged circumstances. And then you can see how people get to a point where
Starting point is 01:10:50
everything feels hard. Like when you're 300 pounds, I haven't never been 300 pounds. But I can't imagine it feels good to get up and move around. It's defeating. I got a friend. He's in excess of 300 pounds. We've been trying on him for years, but no, no win. And he's got crazy psoriasis on the back of his calves. And he actually smells bad sometimes because he can't wash as well as he would. He's big, big. Right.
Starting point is 01:11:18
And it pulls on my sympathy, you know, but life is very hard for him and getting worse. He's a young guy with a lot of medical issues now For obvious reasons and so I think people like that think well, it's already hard Why would I make it harder? Your message is a little different and you have the life experience. It's a lot different. You've been there. So for me Saying oh, yeah, lose weight, you know, I was a skinny guy who got to be a less skinny guy So I don't really have a foot to stand on
Starting point is 01:11:52
What do you say to those people who are like listen? I'm Getting up in the morning is hard trying to not dissolve into a puddle of my own tears of my own misery is hard You are people connect with my book so well. For some reason, God put me in almost every fucked up situation on the planet earth. So when I talk to people, it's not sugar coated because I'm not saying it from, I was a her and saying if I have pounds my whole life.
Starting point is 01:12:21
I don't say much of those people. Maybe you're a piece of shit. Maybe you're, you want to be nobody. Maybe you're happy exactly where you are in life, because obviously you are. Maybe you don't have the determination to be somebody better than who you are. And if you want to live with that, I'll support you in that.
Starting point is 01:12:42
If you're good with being who you are, then every day you wake up and every day you're good with being who you are, that every day you wake up and every day you smell like shit because you can't wash your body well. And your skin's messed up because you're health so bad. And you can't put your clothes on, right? You need help with that. You need help with that.
Starting point is 01:12:55
When I was doing it, I didn't help wipe my ass. That makes you feel good. Nothing can say to you. If every day you wake up with this, see, people are haunted. But they obviously like horror films. Because they keep watching the same fucking movie. I don't like horror films. A lot of people like horror films. So I don't say much to them. I say exactly what I said to you right there. Because I was once you. I didn't like horror films so I changed it. Some people are just they become like you said it gets real small when you're
Starting point is 01:13:31
lazy and you're fat, you will. Their will is so small that they don't have any and you can't give it to them. There has to be something this is this is what I'm talking about now because this isn't a hack. This has to be something this is what I'm talking about now because this isn't a hack. This has to be in you. Something in you has to wake up. And usually the only person that can wake it up is you. Sometimes you can read a David Gogans book because I was all this shit and then a lot more a fucked up. But if you don't have a little flame, you know, just that, just barely, you're done. I can't, I can't light it for you.
Starting point is 01:14:13
And that's the harsh reality of this life that I wanna get across so fucking bad. You can watch me, you can watch you, you can watch fucking Rogan and Cameron Haines, all these motherfuckers, you can go to 20 Robins and fucking bullshit. You're all this shit. You're all this shit.
Starting point is 01:14:29
If you, you could keep going back and keep spending money and spending money and spending money with no results, you can wonder, wow, maybe let me go and try out David Goggins. He ain't going to fucking help you. You have to explore, examine the insides of yourself. And what do you really want in life? Your friend and a lot of people out here just don't fucking want it. So guess what?
Starting point is 01:14:56
Have fun with your life. Go from three to three 50 to 400 to 450 to 500, because you don't want it. And that's the harsh reality. I can't give you shit. You can't give them shit. You can give you ideas. But in the day, when I was losing the weight,
Starting point is 01:15:18
I had to miserably wake up every morning in the cold, because there was Indiana, November's when it started. I was miserable. This is your new life. Take it or leave it. There's no happiness about it. There's no peace behind it. It sucks. It just fucking sucks. And that's the one thing if I could teach anybody anything, it just fucking sucks. And it's gonna continue to suck. And then one day you get to a special part in your life that it might get a little bit better.
Starting point is 01:15:56
But to lose, you have to lose, my friend. Sorry, it's gonna suck every fucking day. Cause in when you're throwing a pound, you're gonna go out to lose weight, you're probably gonna get injured. So then you gotta work on the injury and then you get even more depressed. This is what I went through.
Starting point is 01:16:14
And then you're hungry, cause now you're depressed. It's just a vicious cycle. And if you're not strong mentally, and you have no willpower, you're gonna continue falling back in this whole verse of man that sits back and goes, all right motherfucker, this is why I cussed, this is what is in me. This is what it took for me to be me. Sorry, it didn't take, hey, okay,
Starting point is 01:16:36
we're gonna do this today. No, this fucking really sucks. This is real, dude. This is real. And every day, I'm set back. I'm set back. I'm set back. I'm set back. So this is why I would tell your boy. This is why I'm exactly like tell him. Every day you wake up, you're gonna probably be set back
Starting point is 01:16:54
for the first four weeks before you lose to significant weight because of the mind is gonna be fucking with you the whole time. There's no dopamine. There's no dopamine in there. At 300 pounds, you got nothing. Your hormones are shot. You have to envision something that is more powerful than you. Something has to get you out of bed. And you have to create it.
Starting point is 01:17:18
It has to be false. Because you're not hit. You're a fat piece of shit. And that's the reality of it. So you have to create a false reality to live in that just to get to work on yourself. That's the reality. Hello, he'll see this and he'll appreciate that message. We'll see what he does. So so far last 13 years, it's been no movement. But I've had other friends who So far, last 13 years, it's been no movement. But I've had other friends who were drug and alcohol addicts
Starting point is 01:17:50
who quit after one conversation never went back. That's awesome. I mean, they want it. Yeah, just one guy, I won't out him, but walked up to me at a party in 2019. July fourth party and said, I'm a pile. And I go, what, and he goes, I'm a pile. I go what and he goes I'm a pile look at me I'm 60 pounds overweight I go do drink he goes every day I go how much he goes a case
Starting point is 01:18:11
He goes I smoke a lot of weed but he's successful another areas of his life And so I said well here's what I know quit alcohol and weed for you, you know, I'm not telling people what to do Don't eat until 2 p.m. Get on a exercise bike and pedal in the morning, like someone's chasing you with a poison dart till you want a puke. And I was kind of half joking. Right.
Starting point is 01:18:36
And then two months later, he was, like I haven't had a drink, I lost 30 pounds. He lost that 60 pounds, he never went back. Now he's super fit. It's amazing. So some people flip the switch. He is very self-critical by nature. That's what flips the switch.
Starting point is 01:18:51
He's super self-critical. Yep. That's what flips the switch. Yeah. Think about it, man. We know what to do. We don't need Angie Schuberman to tell us what to do. We know what to do.
Starting point is 01:19:03
Every one of us. That's why he flipped it so fast. Cause he knew what to do. He didn't go by your exact protocol. He didn't go by the exact, no. He knew exactly what to do. And you're just saying some shit to him. It walks up and up, we knew what to do.
Starting point is 01:19:25
And that's the thing that people need to get that. You know what to do, why aren't you doing it? And I'm talking about myself now, those modes of just kind of passive consumption. They're so easy to wash over us. I used to have this thing and I'm fighting this now, because I knew we were gonna have this conversation today where I like to start things on the hour, the half hour.
Starting point is 01:19:46
Right. Worst practice in the world for me. Because if I miss that half hour, I'm like, it's 12.33. I'll start at 12.45. Right. Ah, it's 12.45. I'll start at one.
Starting point is 01:20:01
I just lost time. Right. And then, so this is so stupid, right? And the other day, I was like, man, I gotta tell David about this, because my new thing is, I start no matter what time it is. If I wake up in the middle of the night,
Starting point is 01:20:14
I got a frenzy, paints in the middle of the night. I'm like, you're an insomniac, he's like, I don't know, I just do it. Then sometimes he goes back to the sleep, sometimes he doesn't. Everyone's got their thing, but I thought about this. I'm like, I'm no more am I gonna say,
Starting point is 01:20:24
I'm starting at one, because I know me. If I miss the one o'clock, ding. And my pen's not hitting the paper. Am I not typing on the keyboard? I'm not gonna do it. That's a self-admitted weakness. I love it, man. I had that for a lot of years.
Starting point is 01:20:39
I know I'm gonna do it. That's the haunting part. Is that it's going to happen? I know I'm gonna do it. That's the haunting part. Is that it's going to happen. It has to happen. And that's the fact. Like there's no good audio free carburel. None. Like that is a life that I don't know.
Starting point is 01:20:59
I don't have that ability or I have the ability, I don't have the, or I have the ability. I don't have the, I'm not good enough, smart enough. I'm not talented enough to do that. Some people are. Some people can start at one. Some people don't have to start at all. If you lack talent, you can't sit back and say, I'll start in half an hour.
Starting point is 01:21:30
I can't do that. I gotta start now. And after I get back from starting, I gotta start again. And then when I get them with that run or that study session, if it wasn't good enough, I gotta go back again. Because repetition is what taught me everything. So you can honestly outwork anything,
Starting point is 01:21:47
but that you obviously are a very talented man. Well, I have worked hard at certain things and built up some things that I've been good at most in my life, gathering, organizing and disseminating information, something I've been doing since I was a little kid. I used to give lectures at school on Monday about stuff I learned over the weekend. See, check that out. But they took me to a psychiatrist. We're the same age. Back then, if we got sent to a psychiatrist, people thought you were crazy. I wasn't one. Yeah, exactly. I was one. Exactly. So, so I remember feeling like a freak. Also, I didn't have a start-up
Starting point is 01:22:21
at a grunting tick. It comes back when I'm tired. And the only thing that helped that was hitting my head on something, shaking my head, which is why skateboarding was good, because I slam and I feel like, oh, feel good. That's not healthy. You know, that's not good. Or just work is what gets it out.
Starting point is 01:22:40
It's like an, it's like an RPM or high. Mm-hmm. And you know, anyway, that's me. But, yeah, I think certain things over time, I feel like talent or gifts or whatever you want to call them, but there are many things that are seedingly difficult for me. And I have learned from your example. I know that you are very, both humble and very clear that like you don't have, you say, I don't, you're not going to get it by examining you, but I think the way you're sharing today and the way you shared on other podcasts before, there are pieces
Starting point is 01:23:10
that really help people feel into the process of what you're talking about today. We're elaborating on it. I think a lot, this notion being haunted and the stick. Right. I mean, of course, of course, now it makes so much sense. Why you don't want to talk about sleep or rest or recovery because that's sure that's important. I've heard you say, yes, you sleep, yes, you eat, yes, you hydrate, yes, you, you will stretch your so as or what, but it's funny how that becomes the viral message. That's why I said, fuck
Starting point is 01:23:38
that. But that's not the unique, that's not the, the unique message that you carry. Like anyone can talk about that. So do I have that right that you're acknowledging sleep is important, recovery is important? But that's not what you're about. You have to forego something. Yes, ice baths, sauna, sleep, nutrition, all this shit, so fucking important, dude.
Starting point is 01:24:03
I don't have time for some of it. To get to extract or had to extract something had to give. Like you talk about you and you were younger, you would give these speeches and stuff. The same age you were giving speeches, I was trying to figure out how to say, the without stuttering. And I realized as I got older that all these things are important.
Starting point is 01:24:25
But for me to stop stuttering, I get to build fucking confidence. And speech therapy didn't help that. Nothing helped that. I have to for a go a lot of shit to be as fucked up as I am to build confidence. For me to stand in the fucking room of 10,000, or one person and not, and be like, oh, put my head down, let me look around, let me, let me read these paragraphs first,
Starting point is 01:24:54
and then before I read the paragraphs, cause they call me next, let me just leave the room, come with a stutter. That's a miserable life. And that's one of many things I did besides lying, besides being insecure, besides being immature, besides being fat, besides being one of the only black kids in my school. There's a lot of things I had to overcome to get confidence. And in doing so, a lot of that had to go. A lot of it. So I became the
Starting point is 01:25:22
guy that became once again misunderstood. You only see four hours a day, two hours a day, sometimes you don't sleep at all. Like, what's this and what's this and what's this? I know it's all important. I can't, something's gotta go. For me to get confidence, because confidence is the building block of where I'm trying to go.
Starting point is 01:25:42
For me to gain confidence in myself, this fucked up kid has got to do a lot of fucked up'm trying to go. For me to gain confidence in myself, this fucked up kid has got to do a lot of fucked up shit to gain confidence. And along the way, just started to win away, and I gained confidence. And now my life is a little bit more... There's no balance. There's no balance. It's a little bit more what it should be for a lot of people, but there never be balance because confidence is something that you're constantly confident in belief. You're building every day and so something's got to give and I'm wondering for go a lot of things to have that because I know that is that is if
Starting point is 01:26:19
you want to give somebody a kryptonite, take that shit away from them. So yeah, I don't sleep sometimes and sometimes I don't eat the right way and sometimes I don't do this and do that and whatever, man. But you put me in a room of 10,000 people in time of the day and I walk in there thinking I'm with a bathroom of fucker in here because I know what it took to be on this stage. A lot of people would not do that. So that's what it takes. There's a question I've been wanting to ask you since we started and I thought about coming in here
Starting point is 01:26:50
and I was thinking about in the weeks ahead of this and I'm gonna just come clean and say, I don't exactly know how to ask the question. I ask you. So it's about relationships. Oh, do it, man. So I know in myself that my discipline is much higher when it's just me, but that's because I had certain things
Starting point is 01:27:12
early on, but then I was a terrible student barely finished high school. But then when I got serious, I got serious, but I did that by staying away from everybody. And anyone who's ever had a relationship of any kind, but in particular romantic relationships knows that yes, you can derive tremendous support from those. Like you got this baby, you can go and you're like,
Starting point is 01:27:32
yeah, I got this. She said, I got this. You know, feels great to finish something and share with someone. Share a meal, you know, get the hug it, but there's another side to all of that. That I'd like to learn more about from you, which is, there's a warm body next to you, embed in the morning.
Starting point is 01:27:49
You don't want to get out. They also have needs. You've got your mission that people sometimes need things from us, but also, oftentimes, the people that love us, most that truly love us and that want to support us, don't understand this thing. And they're the first people to tell us, like, listen, take a day off.
Starting point is 01:28:13
And then this whole cycle, at least in my head, goes off, like you just want a vacation and then it's almost like a paranoia. I'm not saying anything nice about myself right now. Right, oh good, former girlfriend's gonna be like, yeah, like, you know, that they remember they, and so support of people close to you is critical. This could be friends, could be romantic partners, whatever.
Starting point is 01:28:32
But they're also the, the knife cuts both ways. It can be the thing that can really undermine this thing that you're talking about. Because the people that care about us also want to see us comfortable. They want to see us happy, they want to see us happy, they want to see us peaceful, they want to see us wake up from a great night's sleep, and they want things too.
Starting point is 01:28:49
So how do you want to tangle that whole bit? Well, it's funny, man. I'm unbalanced, but I'm mostly unbalanced towards the family side. She won't get about me. I start being unbalanced. I get all my stuff in. But what I do is I make sure that my family has everything
Starting point is 01:29:04
they need, everything they need. Everything they need. Those who want to be part of my family. Some don't. Some family members don't want to be part of David Goggins. I get it. I got it. That's life. Those who are part of my family, I get them everything they need, so they can leave me the fuck alone. I make sure you're happy as fuck
Starting point is 01:29:26
cause I gotta go to work. And I don't mean smoke jumping. I don't mean running. I mean all of it. It takes every, I can't have you in my fucking shit. Can't. So I know for me to have a family, I gotta make sure that you realize
Starting point is 01:29:44
I'm gonna give everything a knee so we start bitching that you realize I'm gonna give you everything you need. So we start bitching at me, young, I said, look, hang on. I dedicated my life to give you everything you need. I need this time right here. For me to be the best I can be because this journey started without anybody. And I make sure everybody knows that, it comes in my life. I've been left think about it.
Starting point is 01:30:03
I was left alone at a young age to figure this shit out. I figured it out for myself and it's been very successful for myself. No one's gonna come in here and fuck with my shit. That's why I make sure I will take care of whatever you need. Whatever you need for me, you got it. Money, house, my love, my support, I'm gonna give you everything you need. That said, I do it the highest level possible. And I'm saying it with Jennifer in the next room. So please come in and say something,
Starting point is 01:30:34
if it's wrong, Jennifer, I'm gonna give a fuck. Say what you gotta say. So then, what's time for me to go to work? I expect you to do the same for me, because it takes every bit of me to do what I have to do. So, I make sure that I'm very unbalanced from my family, so I can be exactly that unbalanced for myself. And that's how I do it.
Starting point is 01:30:57
I let people know right up front, I'm not what you want in a man. I guarantee that. Just give you a lot of late nights, a lot of early mornings, a lot of times where I gotta be by myself, thinking about the process that is next in my mind. I can't have aggravation, can have this, can have that.
Starting point is 01:31:19
There's a lot of things, but I let them know up front. I'm very vocal about that. Sometimes relationships work for me sometimes they didn't, but that's who I am. One thing I did wrong in my life was I tried for so many years to please people. And I did it at the expense of myself. I was leaving a lot in the tank. and when you do that you stop living. But the person in your life is happiest, fuck, because you're giving them everything they want.
Starting point is 01:31:52
Their life is full, but you feel empty. And that's not a relationship to me. So for me, it's important that you know exactly who I am because this is what life made. And I'm not trying to change it because I just figured it out. So I'm not trying to compromise David Goggins. I will never, ever compromise David Goggins. That doesn't mean I won't give you what you need and what you want and what you desire.
Starting point is 01:32:22
But I don't need money, I don't need fame, I don't need shit. So I give it all away. What I do need is to make sure that that willpower is worked on every fucking day and every night for the rest of my life. Because that's the one thing that's gonna keep me feeding you, keeping you where you need to be. Because once that willpower is gone, 300 pound David Goggins, he may not be looked like it, but I will walk around with it. So the things that are important to you in life, you must do always or you're nobody.
Starting point is 01:32:57
And that's how I handle relationships. Amen to that. Something I could personally work on is that upfront clear communication. Because I, it resonates that feeling of, like there's something inside that's not getting worked out that I was, when I'm on my own, it's a lot easier.
Starting point is 01:33:14
But then of course, wanting relationships and family, I think that's a healthy part of being human too. Obviously you've worked it out. So I appreciate you sharing that. I don't think I've ever heard you talk about it. People are scared of that. people are scared of that man. People are scared of that conversation with their wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend.
Starting point is 01:33:31
But why are you scared of it? Why are you scared to tell a motherfucker, your wife, your husband, who you are? Who you are, exactly who you are? And that was the problem I had, that's the problem that a lot of us have in life No one knows who you really are No one knew who I really was I
Starting point is 01:33:52
Went to a school where there were a lot of black kids a lot of black kids doing being special ops and They were talked about special ops the black kids Why I was wondering what yeah, I'm not gonna fit in. That's not what they do. A lot of black kids don't do that kind of shit. So whatever I wanted to do, no one really knew the real me growing up. Because I never, when anybody know the real me,
Starting point is 01:34:17
I was always afraid of what you might say or how you're gonna feel or whatever. You got feelings. You have a life that you have to live. So it's important that whatever's on your mind, you let that person know, therefore you're giving them the option to be with you or not.
Starting point is 01:34:34
This is who I am. If you don't like it, that's good man. I got it, but this is David Goggins. So that honest conversation is very important man. So everybody knows where they stand. That person may not be for you. And that's all good. This world could use a lot more of that upfront,
Starting point is 01:34:52
completely honest conversation. I feel like so much of the world's problems are because everyone's dancing around the issues. It takes a lot. Recently in the news, seeing people losing their job, because they won't say something publicly, you can tell they kind of want it. It's like, and people just, I think deep down really crave the direct message.
Starting point is 01:35:09
Like, what are you about? What are you not about? But I think now everyone's afraid of getting canceled. It's a big deal, right? You know, getting canceled that people think, oh, I can't work if I am who I am or if I'm not pretending to be somebody else, then, you know, silence is considered, you know, agreement. You know, there's all sorts of complicated stuff. And I do feel for the generation coming up,
Starting point is 01:35:33
because we didn't have social media. Right. And all of that, that game just walled off from that. There's a real benefit from just not paying attention. People loved the lie. People loved the lie. You know, I thought I was only a person. Like when lie. You know, I thought I was only a person, like when I was growing up, I thought I was only a person that lied.
Starting point is 01:35:48
Because I live in the bubble. And people love to lie about who they're not. They love to lie about who they're not, dude. And that's for me, the reason why I'm so vulnerable and I'm so real and honest, find somebody to come out, tell me I'm lying about my fucking life. And for me to come where I came from and how the rest of me I have now, you're the confidence you get.
Starting point is 01:36:14
How, I don't care who you're gonna judge me. You're gonna judge me, what have you done in your life? So me being so honest and so upfront and so truthful, that came with me finally figuring out who I was but also conquering David Goggins, the demons of David Goggins. Therefore now you're just an open book. You look at somebody looking right in the eye, tell me exactly the fuck you are.
Starting point is 01:36:40
You walk away. I'm good, bro, I know exactly what this journey took to get here. And that gives you a fire and a passion that people can call you nigger, they can call you if you're a lesbian or gay or a bisexual. Call you when you're a fuck you want. If you put yourself in the fire and you come out every fucking day like this,
Starting point is 01:37:00
first of all, not scared to go back in there again. Come on man, you're true, it's real. You come there again. Come on, man, your truth is real. You come on every day, man, with a way of talking to people that people don't have, because there's no truth behind them. And the truth is a starting line. When you sit in the ugly mirror and say, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, you finally started your life, maybe 40 years old, maybe 40 years old, five, six kids, the second you look at that mirror, and you say, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this,
Starting point is 01:37:31
well, basically, I'm not this, I'm not this, I'm not this, I can't do this, I can't do this, I'm all these insecurities, your life finally started. And once you start that life, man, the truth comes out big time, you don't care. So that's the problem. Most people just don't want to have that life, man, the truth comes out big time. You don't wanna care. So that's the problem. Most people just don't wanna have that conversation. It's a point where they can go on stage with the million people and say,
Starting point is 01:37:53
I'm all of this. And have a good day. See you. It's empowering. It's very empowering. I feel like the way we're educated in school, but also outside of school is trained as human beings, these young brains, to try and figure out
Starting point is 01:38:09
how to get positive feedback from other people. It's like we're like little dogs. You have a bulldog. I had a bulldog. Saw the picture of your bulldog. She's great. They're an amazing species. They are.
Starting point is 01:38:22
I think of them economy of effort, or amazing breed, excuse me. They're an amazing breed. They are. I think of them, economy of effort. Yep. Amazing breed, excuse me. They're an amazing breed, economy of effort. They don't do anything unless it's necessary. It's kind of the exact opposite of everything we're talking about. It's kind of interesting, and they're kind of heedness. Yes.
Starting point is 01:38:37
Now it is true that they will, they'll die to protect you. Oh yeah. And it's an instinct. I saw that with Costello, I'm sure that. I saw it with Charlie. Yeah. It's an instinct. But if they're Costello. I'm sure that's. I saw with Charlie. Yeah, it's an instinct. But if they're not in that position, if there's no need to exert effort, they're arrested.
Starting point is 01:38:51
Yeah. So your bulldog's arresting for you. Yes. Got it. Exactly. So you don't need to rest because active recovery Charlie. Perfect.
Starting point is 01:38:59
Perfect. That's going to be your answer from now on. Activities go with Charlie. Does he sleep? Does he rest? No. He somehow worked it out so his bulldog does it for him. Right. But we're sort of indoctrinated into this way of being
Starting point is 01:39:10
from a time that we're young, where, of course, praise feels good, right? So, someone tells you, hey, I like that shirt or good job today or nicely done. For me, because I like growing up in a big packet, friends growing up, and I was never the great staff, it wasn't terrible, it wasn't great, et cetera, like a fist bump or like a feeling crud up,
Starting point is 01:39:30
and you're just like, yeah, but you've talked about this before, in reference to the SEAL teams. We both know a lot of people in that community, and the team's component is a big part of it for a lot of people, and it's a wonderful thing. Right. But there's a danger to that dopamine hit for
Starting point is 01:39:48
lack of a better way to put it from what we can only derive when it's coming from outside. You're talking about being able to either say good job, but also like just look to one's own personal history and say, I've done hard things and I can do it again and again because I do it again and again and again. You're talking about parenting yourself, inspiring yourself, scaring yourself, all of that from the inside. So very different than the way we're raised,
Starting point is 01:40:21
which is to figure out how to get the biscuit. It's funny, man, people figure out how to get the biscuit. It's funny, man. People want to know how I'm always motivated. It's the unseen work, which she just says, the true statement. Those are false dopamine hits that people are giving you, man. There's no belief in that. These are team work, dopamine.
Starting point is 01:40:41
Like, I'm out running it to a clock in the morning, when I'm clocking the morning, in the gym, long't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't No one had me on the back. I did all of the work alone. And while I'm still hard on myself, I know what I did. So whenever times get bad for people, all this who's your career, the bullshit, look, that's real. I hate that people know me for that guy
Starting point is 01:41:20
because that guy is not every fucking day. Like when they see me, they want that energy. That's not me every day. I can extract it immediately when I need you because when you train alone, and I lived alone for so many years in this misery and you're able to get out by yourself, I can take myself to such a level of real,
Starting point is 01:41:41
real passion and purpose in like, the feeling I get is something I can't even explain, by my, I don't need anyone. That's why people come to me to motivate them. No one can motivate me. I have a resume full of fucking motivation that whenever I'm down, like, oh, hang on motherfucker. Oh, you know, you know the truth.
Starting point is 01:42:05
You know that you know the darkness of the fucking dungeons and the fucking demons that fly. You know, and then from there, it's like, okay, you were there. You know this, there was no one there to pick up the rucksack, to pick up the boat, to pick up the log, to go on that, it was you. It was you, there was no pat in the fucking back
Starting point is 01:42:22
at 300 at, at 275, at 250, at 220. No, that was you there was no pat on the fucking back at 300 at at two 75 at 250 at 220 no that was you So those things that come out of me that extract from me in the darkness People are looking for that pound the back. Where is it? Oh? I don't need it Because what I've done is in the fucking unseen work I built Frankenstein. So whenever shit gets nasty, David Goggins goes, you had nobody anyway motherfucker.
Starting point is 01:42:54
So see how I'm talking stuff for now? That's me. That shit fires me the fuck up. That shit makes me fucking nuts. You had nobody anyway motherfucker, look around you. There was no fucking team. It was you. There was no weight loss program or mom and dad wicking you up saying you can do it. You can be better trying to build belief. You built belief when you had nothing. Rock bottom. You did that so as times get hard for me The truth comes out
Starting point is 01:43:26
And my truth is powerful as fuck. It's real It's tangible. I feel it it comes out of my brain as I speak about it I'm reliving every single dark moment of my life To be here So that is what people don't get. That is what motivates David Goggins is the unseen work, but everybody needs that pounded back.
Starting point is 01:43:53
They need that training partner. They need that accountability coach. I don't understand shit, and neither do they. But it's what we've trained ourselves to believe that we need. It's almost like there's this pill on the shelf. I'm speaking in analogy. And we take it and we get jazzed up.
Starting point is 01:44:11
We're like, yeah. But there's this other medicine cabinet behind there. And it's in us. You're saying the real medicine cabinet is inside. Oh, yes. When you continue to overcome, it has so many obstacles overcome. So I had so many obstacles to overcome. So it's actually a benefit to me, but the benefit is not like a benefit like that.
Starting point is 01:44:29
You have to have the courage and the patience to overcome and overcome before you know it, man. You have a whole medicine cabinet, but there's no medicine in the motherfucker. There's no pre-workout. I don't take none of that shit. All I gotta do is flip my brain Put my finger in there and say okay, that's a good one. So I got to do man
Starting point is 01:44:52
I got to roll a text of just like go fuck yourself, Goggins, and oh, but you won Let's do that one a day. There's nothing I need and this is the thing that people don't get about David Goggins. I can't teach it in a one minute video. We all have this ability to have our own medicine cabinet. But unless you go in there and put the medicine in there, it's always gonna be fucking empty. You're always gonna need to pre-work out.
Starting point is 01:45:25
You're all gonna need to, I don't drink coffee, I don't do, I don't do none of that. I don't need, I can run for 70 hours in a hat before. No caffeine. I got all this wonderful shit that I overcame on my own, by myself, in the darkness. That man when it's cold, I'm hot. When it's hot, I can feed myself all the time. That's why when people say, man, why aren't you missing
Starting point is 01:45:54
anything? I can't explain to you, man. Can't explain to you. You're never understand. That's why I don't do all these podcasts, dude. I got, I love you, man. That's why you, my first book, you did a blur for me. That's why I'm here. I love what you're doing for people, man. But I can't explain this. I can't. I can't explain this because people don't wanna do this.
Starting point is 01:46:19
They don't wanna do this, man, but it's, I don't know, man. I get jazzed up even talking about it, man, because so many people think my life is just so, oh, God, his life is horrible. I don't follow him. He's crazy, really? But there are a good number of people, I would say, and that's an undersit that actually do. There are. I think what I'm hearing today, and it's really sinking in, is that a great many people either partially or completely misunderstand you. Yes. I'll put myself in the partially category.
Starting point is 01:46:48
Big time. Because I thought it was about just a forward center of mass, carrot, carrot, carrot, but it's the stick. This is stick. And it's being haunted. And, you know, I do have examples for my own life, which is not what today is about, about being really afraid, and then turning things around. My biggest fear is getting comfortable.
Starting point is 01:47:11
I do not have as much of a stick-oriented approach, but today's conversations changing the way I think. I'm not going to step away from this and think, okay, there are 25 neural circuits that can explain ten of the things that David's talking about about and what I'm thinking about is the fact that everybody has a brain, they have a mind. Forget the brain, the brain's just the physical structure but what that manifests, what that creates is the mind. And everybody has that.
Starting point is 01:47:39
So I do believe that everyone has the capacity to do what you're talking about at some level. I also will be the first to confess that I think you're a highly unusual. Let's just say maybe even n of 1 as we say inside. Sample size of 1. Somebody who has created this process for themselves and keeps them themselves in this forward center of mass with the stick battering the back of their head all the time. Right.
Starting point is 01:48:10
Highly unusual. But this internal medicine cabinet that you're talking about building out true confidence, not needing anything from the outside, I think I like to think that people want that. They want to be known, they're afraid, but that they want to be known for who they really are and that you're describing the path to do this.
Starting point is 01:48:32
And I will say, I'm immensely grateful that you're talking to us this way today about things that you've talked about before, but we're hidden in a little differently. I like to think very different. Because what you're talking about is a process. It's verbs. It's all verbs. Oh, action and it's not about Success it's more actually about Keeping that friction dial to 10 right and that I know energy drink no supplement people often misunderstand me
Starting point is 01:49:00
They think you know like I'm big on people getting sunlight in the morning So they set their circadian rhythm and get better sleep as they get to et cetera. But then people always think they go straight to the supplements. Yeah. What should I take? You know, and then of course people think I'm all about supplements. Supplements are one piece for me, but it's like tiny fraction compared to the doing,
Starting point is 01:49:18
the do's and don'ts. That's why I didn't want to talk about that today. That's why I'm glad I was talking about this. This is it. This is it. Like the brain is the most powerful weapon in the world. And it's crazy how a kid that wasn't real smart. I was forced to go only internal. External had to go away. The external world had to go away and living so deep inside myself, it was me in this brain
Starting point is 01:49:46
and figuring out how this thing works. And it's so many people are doing exactly that, the supplements, the this, the that. I agree, it helps. But once you figure out your, your brain, you become unstoppable to almost anything. Yeah, you can't beat death, you can't whatever, whatever. Your brain is amazing. Once you feed it, the right conversation, the right mental nutrients, the right mental supplements, the right internal dialogue,
Starting point is 01:50:24
at the right time, with the right hit, with the right proof of what you've done in the past, and you send that right to the right circuit, dude, you're a fucking beast, a beast. But once again, you just can't read about it. You can't sit back and be a theorist. You have to be a fucking practitioner. And in that practice is where that becomes
Starting point is 01:50:52
proof positive, who I'm saying is like, God, like David Goggins, he's blowing my mind. What is this? He's not crazy. And so many people, a lot of people have listened to me in the right way and they come back and they're like, I'm totally on board. It happened. It happened. I'm like, keep going man, keep doing it. But that is it man. There's no son. There's no glory. There's no carrot. There's no victory. But there is all of it in one. I can't explain it
Starting point is 01:51:32
real well to people, man. But what you get the other end is something that you're not, you're always found. You're never lost anymore. Doesn't mean the journey's easy. It doesn't get any easier, but you're always found. I love that. I just want to hover on that first set the same way we hovered on haunted in the stick. I think people feel lost. I've certainly felt lost at times in my life. Many times. And yeah, there's that thing. I don't think there's a neuroscience or a psychology term for it. Someone will say put it in the comments and say, oh, yeah, there's that thing. I don't think there's a neuroscience or a psychology term for it. Someone will say put it in the comments and say,
Starting point is 01:52:06
oh, yeah, that's what so and so said. But like you said, we're not trying to be theoretical here. We're trying to be practical. The business of finding yourself and knowing like, but it's sort of like, I'm safe because I'm in danger and I've been in danger before and I got myself out. It always seems to come back to verbs. Again, I don't have a language for this.
Starting point is 01:52:27
You know, for once, I'm lost for words. There's like, it's about a process, the algorithm. And the reason, here I'm just kind of trying to make sure I'm understanding things correctly, one of the reasons why it must be uncomfortable for you to be who you are publicly is because people want us to focus on the running or the swearing And by the way the swearing is is welcome. I'll tell you I came up through laboratories We're all three people I worked for
Starting point is 01:52:55
Swore a lot, but there was one rule. I couldn't swear at people So my graduate advisor brilliant woman unfortunately she died early. They all died early I'm the common denominator. I had that internalized for a long time. Anyway, she said, but if you swear at people, you're out. But you can swear as much as you want. So that's the rule I have. It's like, you can swear as much as you want,
Starting point is 01:53:16
just don't swear at people. If you swear at people, better be ready to fight. Right. Definitely not going to fight you. So you can swear at me, get away with it. But the fact of the matter is that it must be frustrating that people, because I know people, oh, it's all about supplements and ice baths.
Starting point is 01:53:31
Listen, I like supplements. I love supplements and ice baths, but that's not the full picture. They're just a gravitational pull. It's the swearing, it's the running. It's his feet that are all messed up. It's the fact that he got a triton. Is this seal guy?
Starting point is 01:53:44
Yeah. I'm talking about that too, right? You know, and there's a gravitational pull for people and they're missing like the, that's like the tip of the iceberg is what I'm realizing. I'm realizing that today, thanks for the way you're phrasing things. Because the bigger vessel is all in here. And as you said, how do you put that in a book? It's impossible because it's highly individual. Yeah.
Starting point is 01:54:04
You do it your way. Yes. And you're saying everyone needs to go figure out how to do it their way for them. Yes. And the thing about being misunderstood is very frustrating. More than I can even imagine, I can't even express how frustrating it is when the cussing and everything comes from a place of real,
Starting point is 01:54:27
I can't explain what I do without it. The passion comes out of me, it's almost like speaking in tongues because when you put that much work in people, oh yeah, there's been this basketball player, this football player, this dude, no, no. I'll play or this. Dude, no, no. Everything, everything is work, everything.
Starting point is 01:54:52
And people don't believe it. So when I speak, the motherfucker and the fuck and the shit and that is what it took for me, and shit and that is what it took for me. What it takes for me, the anger, the passion, the jaw dropping, just, it takes that because I'm not that. This is how I look at it, man. What built this guy?
Starting point is 01:55:25
Let's imagine being in the coldest water you can possibly take. I always go back to hell with this. I hated the water. Hated it. You're sitting in the locked arms and you're in the water all the time. And they're bringing you in the water, in the water. When you have this dialogue in your head, and these people are judging
Starting point is 01:55:46
me off of freaking one minute video and you're constantly your whole life. When you figure it out 24, I got a, I just got to this fucking gotta. This is just going to suck. Every day is going to suck. And live like that to be better. And I put this, I'm in the water, the water's going on my head, the Pacific Ocean, you know it's freezing February, cold as shit, been through three hell weeks. For you to constantly win, win, win, when this voice over here, the real you is saying,
Starting point is 01:56:22
get the fuck outta here, go, you is saying, get the fuck outta here. Go, you're nobody. You've always been nobody. And it's true. People don't hear that. That's a true voice. That's the real reality of David Goggins at 24 years old. It's not a false reality.
Starting point is 01:56:41
And then you had to create another voice over here that is saying you're better than that other voice and you're in the freezing cold water that both voices don't want to fucking be in but you win and goes from the water to the studying to the running to losing weight to how you eat, to how you function as a man. Every day of your life you're winning these battles and then I have normal people who only have one voice. Never created the second voice. The winning voice is the second voice. They have one voice and that's just I'm a piece of shit. And that's all they hear. And then they judge people like me
Starting point is 01:57:31
who are out here trying to be better. It's something that I can never really, it's a frustrating thing for me. Cause I know the majority of people people I know it goes on to bring out study to my more than almost more than you because I wasn't I'm a practitioner so for you to be a piece of shit and come out of that you don't just come out of it you spend decades studying your mind in the human mind, on how it functions in good environments,
Starting point is 01:58:09
bad environments, stressful environments, patient environments. You studied all because you had to put all this together to create the mind to become successful. So I had to, like God blessed me with this brain, I had to create a mind. And so I'm doing so, I figured out every piece of shit human being in the world,
Starting point is 01:58:28
because that's what I was going off of for myself. So I know why you go on Instagram. I know why you, because you just have the time, you have the time because you don't wanna put that time into bettering oneself. So I know why I misunderstood. I misunderstood by people who have plenty of time on their hands to misunderstand me because they are exactly where I once
Starting point is 01:58:57
was, which is a low life lazy piece of shit. There's the harsh reality of people who troll you, who go after you, they have nothing better to do with your lives. It's not some after school special. It's the truth by once was that way. I know where it all comes from. That's why it's frustrating me now, because I'm not so frustrated at the fact that I'm being trolled.
Starting point is 01:59:22
I'm frustrated by the fact that you don't have the courage, the courage to try to be somebody better than which you're not. And that's the first training part. It's interesting because earlier, we were talking about relationships. And you said, in a very candid way, and I really appreciate you sharing that, that you make sure that the people close to you,
Starting point is 01:59:43
your family has everything they need. Right. And that they also understand that you're going to take what you need to continue to build you. Right. Period. Period. In some ways, it seems you've also included the general public in that family. You're saying, listen, I'm going to give you what you need.
Starting point is 02:00:01
I'm going to give you as much of myself as I can, except I'm going to stop right at the line that if I were to cross it is going to prevent me from continuing to build myself. By the way, this relationship only exists because I don't cross that line. And I think as much as there are detractors out there, people that try, I mean, it's pretty whatever they're doing is brief feeble in my mind. I mean, it's like cap gun fire. You know, people that try, right? I mean, it's pretty, whatever they're doing is brief feeble in my mind. I mean, it's like cap gun fire, you know? If that, you know, so many of us,
Starting point is 02:00:35
men and women, old and young, hear something and feel something in your message. Well, like, yeah, like it seems kind of crazy, gosh, like, doesn't he ever just relax, you know, what about his sleep, you know, like, you know, like, he's gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna injure himself. I've heard, listen, I'll be very direct. I got friends who were in the team as you just go, yeah, what's he gonna do when he can't run? And I know the answer is to keep running. Right. Right. But it's more comfortable for people. Mm-hmm. Even high achievers.
Starting point is 02:01:02
Especially high achievers. To believe that if you took one thing away, that it would all go away. It's absolutely clear that's not the case with you. I'm 100% convinced. I just know that because what we're talking about is this. Dimmie Thompson, I haven't been able to run two heart surgeries, multiple knee surgeries, and after every knee surgery they say,
Starting point is 02:01:20
you're not going to run again. And I'm fine with that. There's no running up here, bro. None. This was what it was all about. That's what they lost. What if you can't run? Give a fuck?
Starting point is 02:01:34
It was never about running. Why do you think I run? It's the worst thing I hate doing it more than anything. Hence the willpower. Right. Your anterior mid-singulate cortex would be, would start to regress if you loved running. Think about it. Every day I wake up, I don't just run a mile, two miles,
Starting point is 02:01:56
it's the one thing I hate the most to do and I do it like I love it. 250, 60, 700, 300 mile runs at one time, no sleep. In every step, when I get to think about this, I get to the fucking start line. Custening at Jennifer. Why the fuck am I here, I hate this shit. After 70 some hours of running,
Starting point is 02:02:23
every fucking question I ever had is answered. Every question I had is answered. I cap success. I don't, people go, we mean you cap success. For me to be who I am. So when I go smoke jump, I'm smoke jump three to four months out of the year. Sometimes five. Could you just for those that aren't educated, right? Just like give us a brief description of what smoke
Starting point is 02:02:54
jumping entails. So basically you, you jump into fires, not into them, but jump by fires that people can't get to. So out of planes and helicopters. Right. Out of planes. As you, it can't get to. So out of planes and helicopters. Right, out of planes. So I slow you down. It's all parachuting. So you parachute at airplanes and then you fight the fire. You and sometimes for the guys or maybe eight of the guys,
Starting point is 02:03:14
guys and gals, and you're putting this fire out. So I lose millions of dollars every summer to do this. It blows people's minds. Why the hell are you doing this? And you're breathing, Seth. Being a set, knees are jacked up, hitting the ground, hurting, whatever. Talking to normal people, they'll never get it, so I don't even explain it to them. But this is why I call it cap success.
Starting point is 02:03:40
I'm talking financial success. For me to continue having that willpower, the second, I just become a speaking monkey and travel around and speaking gigs 12 months out of the year. Put camps on, do this, put on lectures, get supplement lines and do this and write more books and shit. I've ruined the exact thing I worked on my entire life. And while I didn't know it until the day, but something always told me, this is a very,
Starting point is 02:04:14
very, very perishable skill, this will power that you have, because I do have a will power that I have never seen in anybody in my life is a haunting force that this keeps me going. And I know that that is my strength. If you have that, so that's worth every dime I've ever made in my life. It's the fact I can look at man in the eye finally. I have real conversation without going like this because I'm lying or I'm a piece of shit
Starting point is 02:04:43
or I know, you know how a person in so many people do this shit. They're talking to you on who they want to be. They're lying to you and they walk away. I've done it so many times. Walk away like, God, man, why can't I just tell me the truth? Why the hell can I just tell him the truth? No, good it feels for me now to look at you and your eye and every man, a man I see. Cause we won't get this, women will not get this. Man to man, that man's shit. You look another man to eye
Starting point is 02:05:17
and you know that everything you're fucking saying is real and it comes from a real working place, something that you earned. It's the best feeling of the world. You can say that actually happened. Like I know with certainty what I'm saying actually happened. Who I am and who I say I am, I am no more lies, no more skirt in the truth, no more bullshit.
Starting point is 02:05:39
And that is worth every dime that ever made my life. And I swear to God on that every dime I've ever made in my life. And I swear to God on that. Every dime I've ever made in my life, building who I built. So I can cap success because I know that if I ever go 12 months out of the year and don't put several every day, I'm going at it. But several months out of the year,
Starting point is 02:06:03
I go right back to ground zero. Which means I'm just fucking David Goggins. No Goggins. No carry boats, fucking logs, bullshit. It's just pick up that fucking pelasky and dig. Hey, get that fucking pump, walk down a mile, put it in the fucking water, and the skewers beaten, you're just David Goggins. You're nobody Because that's where my growth is that's where my willpower comes from and that's where it stays
Starting point is 02:06:32
That's what I talked to you now and then came I talk like this dude People don't talk with kind of passion because it ain't there It ain't there. They're they're regurgitating some shit from 30 fucking years ago. I'm a girls sitting, sitting shit from an hour ago. Hour ago. Come on, man. It's just be real and I can't be on these podcasts. I can't talk to anybody without being real. I'll go away.
Starting point is 02:06:58
I'll go away because I can't give you what I want to give you. You said perishable skill. I think that's another word. Set a words I want to highlight because skill implies behavior. And when we were just talking a second ago about the deep true bedrock sense of confidence that comes from looking someone in the eye and telling somebody something that you absolutely know
Starting point is 02:07:23
it's true because it happened, you're talking about actions, not talking about perceptions, you're not talking about what you believe happened, you know it happened. And there's something really concrete about actions. I mean, that's what's so interesting is, we're talking about the mind,
Starting point is 02:07:38
but actions are the manifestation of the mind. And the stuff that just stays in here, people die with that. It doesn't go anywhere. I long ago, somebody said, I forget what the context was. It was a neuroscientist. He said, most emotions,
Starting point is 02:07:55
like they're just emotions. They're just in there. Like you don't have to do anything with them. And I think certain emotions you want to do something with. But I think people forget this. They feel miserable, like they're gonna dissolve into puddle of their own tears. No one ever died from an emotion. Right.
Starting point is 02:08:09
But they feel like they overwhelm us as if it's a tidal wave. It's going to pull us under and drown us. It's so interesting to me because I think what people... Listen, you have a gravitation pull. People can feel the energy. I think yes, you're either completely badly or partially understood. There's only one guy on the plant that truly understands you. I think there's one woman, Jennifer, who probably understands you as much as anyone's going to. And then the rest of us
Starting point is 02:08:35
are kind of grasping, trying to figure it out. But you're saying go inward. So first go inward. And then it's actions. Inward and actions. Now the inward piece is something I'd like to just spend a little bit of time on because there are a couple characters from history people that were in concentration camps. Nelson Mandela, I mean, I'm not sure he had Instagram in there and pre-shoot didn't.
Starting point is 02:08:58
And I don't think there was anyone coaching him on like, hey, you're gonna get out someday and actually you're gonna lead an entire country. I'm pretty sure that's not how it worked. He had to find it here. He had to find it between his ears. Right. And there are other examples, but that's an important one. So the process of going inward, does it for you? And here I will ask for suggestions because I think people want, there are those of us who want to build this skill right Waller yourself off phone off for big portions of the day perhaps texting off
Starting point is 02:09:37
requests the this the that Anyone that knows you knows that I we've communicated a few texts, but most of it comes through filter She's great. She knows you you know, and she knows how to protect your time and the person was feelings people get mad about it Hey God bless God bless you Jennifer, you know Cutting oneself off when you're in there you say it's just you And the voices that come up are not pleasant. And then at some point, it converts to action. Okay.
Starting point is 02:10:16
How much, what is the process of picking the action? That's the piece that I feel like there's like a bridge to build here, if you can, if you would. So the act should be like, like, like, what's next? Yes. So what, like, when you go, go to sleep at night and when that happens, you know what you're going to do the next day? It's pre-planned.
Starting point is 02:10:35
Yes. Okay. Yes. It's always the same thing. You're not building it on the fly. No, nothing on the fly. Nothing. So, how works internally for me is, I I'm I put it exactly how it is.
Starting point is 02:10:47
I'm an artist and every day I'm putting I'm painting more Lisa every day and it's a different one. It's not the same painting. So every day I wake up you know they're the same thing it takes a different way to get there. So every day in my mind, I'm going through my mind, I'm just like, and a good painter will not just paint. He needs to create. And you can't create the phones and everything going around you. So you gotta block yourself off. You only do two podcasts in a year.
Starting point is 02:11:21
You block yourself off and you're painting this thing inside, and you're going through all these different colors of painting, everything else. And you can only figure out the right painting if you spend the correct amount of time in your brain. So every single day, I'm literally going through my, and I'm painting, I'm creating this masterpiece. And the masterpiece is always myself.
Starting point is 02:11:45
And but to do that, you cannot have any distractions. Because if you're talking to an artist, and he's trying to think about the next painting, he can't. It's impossible to listen to you and listen to what your mind and body are telling you we must do. People don't do enough of.
Starting point is 02:12:03
They don't do any of it. You're, they don't have passion, they lack passion, drive determination because you haven't spent time with yourself. Your mind will tell you what is next, but you haven't spent the time to go, all right, let me just figure this out. You're looking for, let me Google this and let me Google that and let me, you're not gonna find it there because there's billions of people in this world
Starting point is 02:12:36
and they're all supposed to be individuals. We have a pack mentality. That's where you're so fucking lost. Why am I so unique? I'm being exact what the fuck I was supposed to be. I ain't fall shit. And when I did fall shit, I was like, everybody else. The second I said, okay, man, hang on, dude. You don't like this, you don't like this, you don't like this.
Starting point is 02:13:02
Who are you, David Goggins? Who are you supposed to be? Miraculous. See all these things, just, I couldn't even, the list of shit I had to do, just, why am? It's like, fuck, okay. Wow, once you sit down with yourself and say,
Starting point is 02:13:19
okay, I don't wanna be like Michael Jordan or Jim Brown, the both of them are birthday. So I looked at their birthday and said, oh, maybe I can be one of these? I can't. I'm going to be David fucking Goggins. And that looks like this. It just came, everything flooded.
Starting point is 02:13:37
So every single day of my life, there's a different thing that comes up that I have to do. But no one knows what to do because everybody else's following steps like the Republican and Democratic parties. I'm not political. Neither am I. At all. For this reason, Republicans are going to vote Republican.
Starting point is 02:13:59
Democrats are going to vote Democrat. You're not even a human fucking being, bro. No way are you fuckers agree with all the same fucking shit. And I know I don't. So once you figure out yourself and who you are, all the answers come. So every night, a different painting is being painted. And it's a beautiful painting for myself. I'm like, okay, that's that's it. It may look the same to most motherfuckers, but the end result is very fucking different. That's why my laundry,
Starting point is 02:14:31
if you look at what I've done in 49 years, it's more than most people are ever doing the life because they were a race car driver. And that's what they did. They drove a fucking car. It's great. I was all kind of shit because that's exactly what the painting was saying to do.
Starting point is 02:14:51
But the mind was saying to do. When saying this driver car is to them, that race car driver, no, what the fuck to do? He retired some being a race car driver and they're lost. Dude, how are you still, I don't get it. Dude, you're never gonna fill your list, but you never found your list, because it never was presented in front of you
Starting point is 02:15:10
because your head was cluttered with shit. Because you never just stopped for lots of minutes, lots of years and they said, all right, it's me and you. Let it go. And this bam, it's right bam, it's right there. It's right there. I'm not a psychologist, as I mentioned before, but I'm an adventurer hypothesis here. I think that you've mastered the process of internal dialogue.
Starting point is 02:15:45
But when I say dialogue, I think most people think, oh, the inner voice, the chatter, but that's just one half of a dialogue. A dialogue is a two-way street. So I completely agree, because I know from experience that when we go inward, oftentimes we hear things, if we're really honest with ourselves, it's like, I don't wanna think about that or that.
Starting point is 02:16:05
No, and then we start looking outward or we start trying to shift our attention and distract. And there are a million reasons that are handed to us excuses and seemingly good justification to be able to do that. But dialogue is a two-way street, and it hit me while you were just saying
Starting point is 02:16:23
what you were saying, I was paying very close attention, and I realized, David Goggins is talking about the voice that comes up, including the terrible stuff that no one wants to hear about themselves from themselves. But then he's also got the dialogue down where he knows the counter voice. He goes, yeah, you're right. And so I'm going to do this. Or maybe no, remember this. You're in a dialogue, a two-way dialogue in there, not a one-way chatter dialogue. There are books written by famous psychologists about chatter trying to shift your internal narrative. You're like,
Starting point is 02:16:59
bring the internal, the internal narrative. That's what going inward is about. But it's not one voice. Again, there's a hypothesis. I'm not claiming to be all knowing. Lord knows I'm not all knowing. Okay. But you've mastered the dialogue and if there are three voices, strong medium and weak in there, you're like, let's all come to the table. So you've got a symphony of voices in there that are all you that you know to be you and you know how to have those Congress you're not afraid to be in those conversations and then you know what what the outcome of that committee decision is and you put into real world action and the world only sees the action. That's it. And only you can know your internal dialogue and only I can know my internal dialogue
Starting point is 02:17:44
and the only way to quote unquote, know it is to spend a hell of a lot of time there. That's right. Okay. A lifetime. Got it. A lifetime, think about it. For me to be sitting here in front of you,
Starting point is 02:17:58
you're not gonna call 300 pound E.C.O. lab guy to come sit here, you might, I don't know, maybe, probably not. Probably not. Think about this. When we teach people, it's kind kindness to yourself. Do you think if I taught myself kindness, and I agree with it, God, so many people, so many people take me out of context, it's ridiculous. Take it however you want to take it? When I asked 300 pounds,
Starting point is 02:18:28
we think that conversation that got me if I spoke kindness to myself, I'll take where it gets me right back to 7-11, another box in mini-chucket donuts, in the chucket milkshake. That's the one voice. That's the one voice that most of us have that you're talking about. If you're never conversation in there, the other voice that you create that says, okay, how does this look? It looks very ugly. That kind of conversation for me went away a long time ago, which is why the dialogue is now, which you see a lot of action because most people have inaction because it's one person talking and that one
Starting point is 02:19:13
person is always leaning you down the same path, the path that makes you feel very comfortable and happy with yourself. The second you create the other voice, there's conflict, there's battles, there's wars, there's defeat. One thing I learned, I taught myself this and people go, I don't understand what you're saying, I'm going to try to break it down real quick. I didn't teach myself victory first. I taught myself failure. I taught myself how to fail. And people are like, that's so depressing, is it? When you're 300 pounds and you can't read and write and you're fucked up,
Starting point is 02:19:55
you know, many times you're going to fucking fail on that process. So if you don't know how to fail, there is no victory. I never talked about winning. Because I knew the path to winning was to be years of failing first. So I taught myself how to fail properly. No one teaches you how to fucking fail. But if you're going out for insurmountable fucking odds that make absolutely no fucking sense,
Starting point is 02:20:24
a black kid that can't swim 300 pounds of your Navy seal. Okay. You better teach yourself how to fail first. Because if you sit in failure for too long, you will never come out of it. So the first part of my success was learning how to fail properly. And then eventually, I started getting a few victories. But that's what people don't get. When you have buried yourself in such a deep fucking hole, you better first talk about the failures you're going to have first.
Starting point is 02:21:01
And that's when that other voice comes up. It tells you we got to do something. It also tells you, boy, I'm not gonna lie to your goggins. You're in for a fucking climb, bro. You're gonna get your ass handed to you, may fun of the outside noise, the inside noise. Both voices are gonna be fucking telling you to go fuck yourself.
Starting point is 02:21:22
You are in for hell, bro. I am. Sorry, in for hell, bro. I am. So I'm gonna go and just fail. So this is what you mean when you say that whatever anyone says, it's insignificant. It's insignificant as fuck. Right, it's the cap gun fire because it's just like, it, because the voice in your own head is,
Starting point is 02:21:39
it's far worse. That, that, and I should say, sorry, one of the voices in your head. Yes. Yeah, I'm, I'm being very, like, detailed, almost surgical about that, because I think this thing about inner dialogue, we think, is one voice. Yes. You're making it clear it's many voices.
Starting point is 02:21:53
It is. And the thing about it is, you have to be really, and sometimes all the voices are telling you the wrong shit, man. But through years, years, not a podcast or listening to a book or reading a book, years of sacrifice, of suffering, of diligent, pinpoint, fucking work on what you wanna do for yourself. Not like, oh, let me just do a bunch of shit.
Starting point is 02:22:24
Let me, I wanna be in every task possible. No. Pinpoint what I want to do with my life. What happens is you have all these voices that are telling you you're fucked up and this can be hard, but for some reason, you put so much practice into you that you can ignore every one of them that
Starting point is 02:22:47
are telling you you're not going to fucking make it. And still be able to fucking make it. Because you have put the practice in that you know this is the process. It's such a daunting task that all the voices are saying no. But you still have the conviction that I know I can do this. And that's what it took for me to get here. 20, 30 years ago, I had this 35, whatever it was, 25 years ago, pipe dream. And ever since then, every voice was like, you're a fucking nut. But when you put that practice in every day, you lace them up. And I mean, Ron, it's just a metaphor for life.
Starting point is 02:23:34
When you lace them motherfuckers up every day, pretty soon you win. Pretty soon you'll fucking win. If you have the curvers in the heart and the dedication and the minds of everybody, go fuck themselves. I know what I know. I've listened to myself enough to know I Know what I know nothing you can hear what I'm hearing And that's what people don't do enough of they don't listen to their journey They listen to everybody else is shit before you know it. I'm crazy, but I'm so fucking crazy
Starting point is 02:24:04
Why am I so successful? How that happened? I'm so misguided and mis-fucked up and don't listen to him. Why am I the only one to do a whole bunch of shit? Why am I a trod laser? Why? How is that possible? How can you be fucked up and also self-made the same fucking, no, no.
Starting point is 02:24:30
Obviously, you're not looking at the truth in front of you. The truth in front of you is it sucks. It's painful. It's fucking my numbing. And that is the truth. And that's why a lot of people don't like listening to me because this is what it takes creating another voice and sometimes going out of the loan. All the time going out of the loan because no one's going to believe in you. And that's
Starting point is 02:24:57
that. What I'm about to say is not conjecture and I can say that with confidence because I did a four episode guest series with an Abrilliant psychiatrist, a guy named Paul Conti, Trenton, he's a Stanford Harvard trained guy, he's also got last street, and he's got his own real hardship. He's brilliant and he said something
Starting point is 02:25:18
that I'll never forget, which is, you know, we think that the four brain, the part of our brain that creates strategy, et cetera, is the super computer. He said, no, no, no, no, no. It's like the super computer of the brain is the unconscious mind. It's the part of our mind that's controlling most everything.
Starting point is 02:25:38
And most people, unfortunately, don't do the work to understand how they're unconscious is controlling them. And that's a scary thing. This idea, like your mind is controlling you, you know, and I'm not going to get into the free will debate. I believe in at least some will. I believe what you're describing and this internal dialogue, I think you have access to your unconscious mind. You, by listening to the dialogue going inward, we know this is true in sleep, in dreams, in meditation, and just by shutting out everything else,
Starting point is 02:26:10
shutting out all the external noise, which is filled with things that pull us twice. Noise makes it sound bad, but it's the gravitational pull of all the things that just allows to distract ourselves without knowing that, you know, it's the ice cream, that have a cookie, the Merry Christmas. The unconscious mind, this huge piece of the iceberg underneath
Starting point is 02:26:29
that Paul calls the super computer. He's saying that with knowledge as a neurobiologist, psychiatrist, psychologist. I mean, really knows. That's the piece that if one does real introspection, he calls it the cupboards. You got to look in the cupboards and it's often really scary what you find in there.
Starting point is 02:26:46
And most people are just like, I don't even want to know the cupboards are there. But you're pulling all the cupboards doors open. And then you're extremely deliberate with what gets put into action. You're not just going, oh, like I'm pissed, so I'm an act pissed or I'm tired, so I'm an act tired. You're picking very carefully what to do. And that's a process that, I'm guessing came to you, does it come to you as a, okay,
Starting point is 02:27:13
it makes sense why running makes sense. It makes sense why smoke jumping makes sense. So it seems like a huge portion of your time is spent understanding yourself and making sense to you. And so when people don't understand you, it's got to be extra frustrated. Yes. Because most people don't understand themselves. So we're all running around and going like, you're this and you're that.
Starting point is 02:27:38
Because most people are just unwilling to look inward. And I'm including myself by the way. Right. I mean, I've done a fair amount of introspection, but I'm inspired today, that word inspired, but it's true, motivated to start going inward further. Because it is scary. It's like we don't know what's in those covers, and it's terrifying. Yes. Especially because we don't know. And those are the first ones to open up. And like he talked about, you got to through his cupboards, I do spring clean every fucking day, in those dark cupboards.
Starting point is 02:28:07
Those dark cabinets that want to start with first. That's the real meme, man. That's the real meme. That's why I'm not ashamed. I don't hide. I used to hide. I don't hide anymore. He's exactly right.
Starting point is 02:28:21
I don't know all the fucking science behind shit. I know what I know. That's why I'm listening to anybody anymore. I'm listening to shit. I think most people are full of shit. Because I know I know the deep dark secrets of those fucking cupboards. It's ugly man. In every day I'm talking to him, every day I'm cleaning them. I'm cleaning them and I'm talking to the same demons that came out of those fucking covers as I'm cleaning them. Sometimes they go right back in them again. It's not easy. And this is why most of us just, why him misunderstood. Because when it comes out of those cabinets that I'm cleaning, sometimes they see on Instagram. Something that they'll see in the park. And sometimes they see in this one.
Starting point is 02:29:04
I turn on people off, open up your own cabinets and then go talk about it. Let me see how pretty it looks. Let me see how pretty you sound. Let me see how put together your words are. I bet you a fuck or a motherfucker comes out because for you to go back in there again to clean the same fucking cabinet The demon came out of take some big balls, bro To do it every day of your life To go back in there and spring clean every day not once a fucking year Once every decade
Starting point is 02:29:41
Every day, you know it gets dusty and every day you don't start with the victories. You don't go, oh, this is nice. Look at my, look at my, I love me. Well, let me clean up this little dusty. Nope, I go right for the things and I go keep me buried. And I go right there first because if I don't clean those out first,
Starting point is 02:29:59
the day doesn't start. So what are you saying? To me, it's truth. And like I told you many times that I can never figure out how to explain this shit to people because I'm not neuro nothing. I'm just a guy that said okay, we got to start in the dungeon and we got to stay here for the rest of our lives. in the dungeon and we got to stay here for the rest of our lives. For you to become successful, the dungeon is a place that has to be clean and it's the scariest place to be. That's why I'm misunderstood because I'm speaking from the dungeon. That's why I am successful because I go there every day and day and that is the truth what he says. It's the exact truth.
Starting point is 02:30:46
Those cabinets are fucking dusty, dirty, and scary as shit. Broken glass, fucking dark, spiders, cobwebs. But most of all, your biggest fears. The biggest things that put you in the fuck the place you are today are in there. So we all like to keep them shut, even like to lock them up, act like they never happen. That's where you never grow. You never improve. You never have real conversations like we're having right now. Never. Never. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, let's not, no, no, no, let's not go there. I talk to so many people who tell me that. Let's talk about this.
Starting point is 02:31:27
Because they'll tell me, but they can only say it once and they'll say it in passing. They won't get deep in the weeds with it. Like you can't just clean it, motherfucker. You got a spit shine that motherfucker. You got to relive it. Every fucking detail of it. You can't say, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, my dad beat me.
Starting point is 02:31:48
You know, you know, it is what it is. It is what it is, motherfucker. It's killing you. It's taking over your whole fucking life. But that's the conversation. Yeah, my dad beat me. I'm fine now, though. I'm good.
Starting point is 02:32:02
Okay. All right. No, you ain't. You ain. No, you ain't fine. You ain't fine. This is real talk. People don't have that. So your boys write. 100% right.
Starting point is 02:32:12
Scary is shit. It's scary as shit. But makes you who you're supposed to be. And that's the test. We forget, we think we're supposed to breathe air and have kids and pay the bills and shit. Everyone, what's this life about? I mean, no sense.
Starting point is 02:32:34
To be in test it, my friend. Test come when you have not studied. Test come when you think that you're in a great place. That's the test. The test is every day of your life. And most of us fail because we don't know why we're here because we don't go inward to say, oh, you came here a lot of shit to fix, man. And this test sucks. But then you start. But then you start David Goggins I don't think I could add to that. I know I can't
Starting point is 02:33:16
Thank you for sharing what you shared today I mean as Much as your process or anyone's process can't be Completely understood from the outside. You gave us a real window into this thing, this process that you was as you said, God put it on you. I believe in God too. People can believe what they want, but I've said somehow your your life, God gave you these challenges early on, and then there was a point where you went internal. And like you said, you developed a skill, but it's a perishable skill, and you
Starting point is 02:33:57
clearly live in the process of opening those covers, reopening those covers Trying to spit shine those covers understanding that they're never Ever really done, but that you can gain ground on them right you can win day after day after day and You really shared a lot of concrete things that I Think I know people are going to be able to apply if they choose right and I agree with you I think most people will be like, whoa, that was a lot. Yep.
Starting point is 02:34:28
Tevvy, I think I want to just kind of bake myself in Netflix and checks mix instead. But there's also the reality that there are many women, boys and girls, hear that and go, okay, and start cracking the cupboards open. And I just know that, you know, for myself, I'm extremely grateful that you're willing to put it all out there. You're so brutally honest, so brutally authentic.
Starting point is 02:35:00
That word authenticity gets thrown around so much. And I can tell you that for me and for everybody else, like that's really what resonates. So whether or not you want to, whether or not it's the purpose behind it or not, you're lighting the path. So thank you. Respect. Thank you. Thanks for having me.
