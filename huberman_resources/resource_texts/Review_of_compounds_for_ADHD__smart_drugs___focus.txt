Introduction
: Smart drugs are among the most common drugs used by 
students. It is estimated that they are second in incidence after cannabis. 
Although they are usually used for diseases such as attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dementia, in most cases the use of smart drugs 
is illegal and without a prescription.
Methodological issues
: A systematic review was conducted according to 
PRISMA guidelines. SCOPUS, Medline (using PubMed as a search engine), Embase, Web 
of Sciences, and Google Scholar were used as search engines from January 1, 1980 
to June 1, 2021 to evaluate the association between smart drugs and 
neuro-enhancement. A total of 4715 articles were collected. Of these, 295 
duplicates were removed. A total of 4380 articles did not meet the inclusion 
criteria. In conclusion, 48 articles were included in the present systematic 
review.
Results
: Most of the studies were survey studies, 1 was a prospective 
longitudinal study, 1 was a cross-over study, and 1 was an experimental study in 
an animal model (rats). The largest group of consumers was school or university 
students. The most frequent reasons for using smart drugs were: better 
concentration, neuro enhancement, stress reduction, time optimization, increased 
wake time, increased free time, and curiosity. There are conflicting opinions, in 
fact, regarding their actual functioning and benefit, it is not known whether the 
benefits reported by consumers are due to the drugs, the placebo effect or a 
combination of these. The real prevalence is underestimated: it is important that 
the scientific community focus on this issue with further studies on animal 
models to validate their efficacy.
