THE SCIENCE
Exposure to blue and green light (short wavelength light) at the wrong time of day can hinder your ability to wind down for sleep and disrupt your circadian rhythm.
In modern society, artificial light from cell phones, computers, overhead lights, and other sources are prime offenders. Even minimal artificial light exposure can interfere with your natural rhythm and suppress melatonin production, a crucial hormone for sleep regulation. Our Wind Downâ„¢ lenses have been designed to filter out the light in the 400-520nm range of the visible light spectrum. When worn at night, these lenses help prevent disruption and support keeping your brain and body in sync with your circadian rhythm.
