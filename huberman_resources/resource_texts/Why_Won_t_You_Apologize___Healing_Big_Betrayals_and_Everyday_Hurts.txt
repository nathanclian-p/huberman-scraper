Review
"If you want to learn the art and craft of apology and repair when you've hurt someone you care about, this is your book. If you are frustrated with a loved one who is no good at accepting responsibility for hurting you, this is your book. If you want powerful insights into human relationships delivered in personal, enjoyable writing, let me say it plainly: this is the best self-help book I've ever read!"

"With accessible language, luminous examples, and clinical nuance, Harriet Lerner shows us the value and power of apologies--and how and when to deliver and receive them. We applaud her achievement, including her compelling analysis of the dynamics of forgiveness. We recommend this book to anyone who has suffered hurt from others, or caused others to suffer. Who among us has not done both?"
