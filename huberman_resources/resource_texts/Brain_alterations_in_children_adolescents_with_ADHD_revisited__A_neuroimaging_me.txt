Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by age-inappropriate and impairing inattention and/or impulsiveness-hyperactivity based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ADHD is commonly associated with school/academic, occupational, and social dysfunction (Biederman, 2005; Caye et al., 2016). Furthermore, deficit in several cognitive domains has been demonstrated in individuals with ADHD by neuropsychological studies (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010). In addition to neuropsychological, genetics and neurochemical studies investigating the pathophysiology of ADHD (Caye et al., 2016), a large number of neuroimaging studies have been published over the last three decades to elucidate potential structural or functional alterations of ADHD (Hoogman et al., 2017; Konrad and Eickhoff, 2010). However, their findings are often inconsistent or conflicting. Hence, based on these individual studies, the neural correlates of ADHD remain elusive.
Coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) of neuroimaging experiments can overcome this issue by providing a synoptic view of findings across studies, hereby consolidating the existing literature (Eickhoff et al., 2012; Turkeltaub et al., 2002). CBMA uses the reported peak coordinates to identify “if” and “where” the convergence between reported coordinates is higher than expected by chance (Eickhoff et al., 2012). Previous meta-analyses on neuroimaging studies in ADHD have focused on structural imaging (Ellison-Wright et al., 2008; Frodl and Skokauskas, 2012; Nakao et al., 2011; Valera et al., 2007) or task-based functional imaging only (Cortese et al., 2012; Dickstein et al., 2006; Hart et al., 2012, 2013; Lei et al., 2015; McCarthy et al., 2014) (Supplemental Table S1). In addition of being outdated, however, they also yielded inconsistent findings. Meta-analyses of structural imaging studies suggested regional gray matter volume reductions in various cortical regions and also the basal ganglia and cerebellum, but showed limited agreement across analyses (Ellison-Wright et al., 2008; Frodl and Skokauskas, 2012; Nakao et al., 2011; Valera et al., 2007). Likewise, meta-analyses of activation studies heterogeneously indicated aberrations in a wide number of regions covering different cerebral lobes and systems, as well as the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum (Cortese et al., 2012; Dickstein et al., 2006; Hart et al., 2012, 2013; Lei et al., 2015; McCarthy et al., 2014).
Divergence across previous meta-analyses may in part reflects rather low number of included studies, different in-/exclusion criteria, (too) liberal statistical thresholding in search for positive findings (Muller et al., 2018; Tahmasian et al., 2018b). Moreover, heterogeneity in the examined hypotheses, the assessed clinical populations (e.g., subtype or severity of patients), the applied statistical approaches, and last but not least, different practices in reporting negative findings related to the included individual studies are important factors too (Muller et al., 2018; Tahmasian et al., 2018a, 2018b). To address the heterogeneity and statistical power issues of the previous meta-analyses, we conducted a large scale structural and functional meta-analysis, following recently established consensus guidelines for neuroimaging meta-analyses suggested by the developers of all major software packages (Muller et al., 2018). The current meta-analysis is based on the largest number of original ADHD findings, strict adherence to best-practice protocols and stringent thresholding. The main aim of the current study was to find spatially consistent brain abnormalities in patients with ADHD compared to healthy comparisons. Hence, we pooled all the structural and functional studies, to provide a comprehensive overview of grey matter and functional alterations in ADHD. This approach has been applied previously to other neuropsychiatric disorder (Radua et al., 2012; Raschle et al., 2015; Sacher et al., 2012; Tahmasian et al., 2016, 2018a, 2018b; Zakzanis et al., 2003). Moreover, with regard to heterogeneity issues, we conducted several sub-analyses, clustered by extracted factors representing potential heterogeneity sources (i.e., modality, medication status, gender or behavioral subtype ADHD patients as well as specific cognitive domains and stimuli type of the tasks used in task-fMRI studies). By revisiting the issue of neuroimaging findings in ADHD, we thus aim to settle the ongoing dispute on the presence and localization of structural and/or functional brain alterations in children and adolescents with ADHD.
