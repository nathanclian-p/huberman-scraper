"
""Daniel Lieberman and Michael Long have pulled off an amazing feat. They have made a biography of a neurotransmitter a riveting read. Once you understand the power and peril of dopamine, you'll better understand the human condition itself.""

When
""Meet a molecule whose fingerprint rests upon every aspect of human nature—from desire and drugs to politics and progress. Lieberman and Long tell the epic saga of dopamine as a page-turner that you simply can't put down.""??
—David Eagleman, PhD, neuroscientist at Stanford and
New York Times
bestselling author
""I've worked as an artist for forty years, and the question ‘Why am I like this?' has been a puzzle, a mystery, a plea, and an occasional cry to the heavens. Lieberman and Long have created a road map for all those wrestling between insatiable longing and the here and now.""
—Thomas F. Wilson, actor and comedian
""Why do we crave what we don't have rather than feel good about what we do—and why do fools fall in love? Haunting questions of human biology are answered by
The Molecule of More,
a must-read about the human condition.""
—Gregg Easterbrook, author of
It's Better Than It Looks
""As a guy who creates musical stuff for a living and reads science books for kicks, I was doubly hooked by
The Molecule of More
. Lieberman and Long lay out the astoundingly wide-ranging effects of dopamine with nimble metaphors and fat-free sentences. And the research linking creativity and madness, with dopamine as the hidden culprit—let's just say it hit home. Reading each chapter, I felt myself fitting a key smoothly into a locked door, opening onto a fresh-yet-familiar room.""
—Robbie Fulks, Grammy-nominated recording artist
""Jim Watson, who deciphered the genetic code, famously said, ‘There are only molecules; the rest is sociology,' adding fuel to C. P. Snow's complaint that Science and the humanities are two fundamentally different ""cultures"" which will never meet. The authors argue provocatively, yet convincingly, that the molecule that allows us to bridge the chasm between them is dopamine. Though written for ordinary people, the narrative is sprinkled throughout with dazzling new insights that will appeal equally to specialists.""
