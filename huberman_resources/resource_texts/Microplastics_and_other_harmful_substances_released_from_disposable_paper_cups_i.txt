Paper and paperboards are some of the most common or preferred types of food packaging materials. They have gained popularity in the process of food packaging as they are easily available, affordable, light-weight, and successfully act as a barrier to moisture, oxygen, and microbial entities. One such commonly used food container is the disposable paper cup. They are a popular option for most individuals while consuming their favorite beverage. Disposable paper cups are used in most coffee and tea outlets globally (Poortinga and Whitaker, 2018). Disposable paper cups are made of 90–95% (by weight) paper, and the remaining 5–10% (by weight) is a hydrophobic plastic film (Mitchell et al., 2014, Constant, 2016, Arumugam et al., 2018). Mostly, the interior layer is made of Polyethylene (PE), and sometimes copolymer alternatives are also used (Rogovina et al., 2013).
Several studies in the past have shown that harmful chemicals and substances can leach from paper and paperboard-based food packaging into the food meant for human consumption (Choi et al., 2002, Hansen et al., 2013, Schaider et al., 2017, Trier et al., 2011, Trier et al., 2018, Deshwal et al., 2019, Vandermarken et al., 2019). Several additives are used to treat plastics, layering the paper to make them gain desired properties like flexibility, color, and protection from microbial activity. Some organic compounds used in the treatment of paper and paperboard food packaging have also shown the potential to migrate into the packed food (Xue et al., 2019). Phthalate compounds like di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and di-n-butyl phthalate are plasticisers used during the production of paper and paperboard packaging, these compounds increase the flexibility and the durability of the packaging materials (Lopez-Espinosa et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2008, Chang and Chen, 2010, Fierens et al., 2012, Hahladakis et al., 2018). Antioxidant additives like phenolics and organophosphites are used in the polymers to delay the process of degradation (Hahladakis et al., 2018). Fluoride based compounds like the perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs) are used for the treatment of paperboards and papers to make them waterproof and oil-repellent (Trier et al., 2011, Trier et al., 2018, Schaider et al., 2017, Schultes et al., 2019). Leaching of heavy metals into food from paper-based food packaging has been detected (Elmas, Gulnur Mertoglu Çınar, 2018). Even biopolymers used in food packaging are combined with nanofillers like silicates and carbon nanotubules to reduce their crystallinity and increase flexibility (Souza and Fernando, 2016). However, concerns regarding leaching of microplastics from these food packaging materials have rarely been addressed or quantified. Microplastics have been identified in many food substances like salt (50–280 Microparticles/kg of salt) (Iñiguez et al., 2017, Sathish et al., 2020a), branded milk (6.5 ± 2.3 particles/L) (Kutralam-Muniasamy et al., 2020), fish and other seafood (Jovanović, 2017, Smith et al., 2018, Sathish et al., 2020b), and tea from teabags (11.6 × 10

microplastics/plastic teabag) (Hernandez et al., 2019). Disposable paper cups being one of the most commonly used forms of food packaging, the potential for migration of plastic particles into the hot beverages needs serious attention.
The objective of this study was to identify the types of plastic layers used in paper cups and evaluate the changes in their mechanical, physical, and chemical properties when they come in contact with hot liquid. The microplastic load in the liquid was also quantified, and the particle size distribution was analyzed.
