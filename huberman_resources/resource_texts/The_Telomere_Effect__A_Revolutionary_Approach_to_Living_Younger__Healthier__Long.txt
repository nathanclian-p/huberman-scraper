One of the Best 'Brainy' Books of This Decade -
The Guardian
A ground breaking book on the history of Telomeres offering fresh advice on how to slow down aging and lengthen life. Nobel prize winning Doctor Elizabeth Blackburn and leading health psychologist Dr Elissa Epel have discovered biological markers called Telomeres which can help to understand how healthy our cells are and what we can do to improve them.
The book specifically looks ideas including; how biological age is not chronological age; a biological basis for the mind-body connection, how sleep and diet can affect telomeres and shockingly how mothers who are highly stressed during pregnancy have children with shorter telomeres. It also offers tools and advice on how to determine cellular age and telomere health.
Doctor Elizabeth Blackburn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009 for her discovery of telomeres and their role in the ageing process and has previously been named in TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential People.
Dr. Elissa Epel is a leading health psychologist who has conducted pioneering research uncovering the psychobiological mechanisms related to how stress ages us and compromises our health-from emotional eating to unhealthy storage of abdominal fat to telomere shortening.
