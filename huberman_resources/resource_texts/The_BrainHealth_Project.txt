The goal of The BrainHealth Project is to better improve brain health by identifying actionable strategies for optimizing it throughout life. Up to 100,000 healthy adults of all ages will be enrolled and tracked for at least ten years. You can complete the study entirely online through the BrainHealth app or your web browser.
A smaller group of local Dallas participants will also have the opportunity to complete a series of brain MRIs over time. Brain imaging data will be used with the online data to help understand the brain mechanisms driving individual differences in brain health changes over time.

Why Should I Participate?
The BrainHealth Project is a landmark study that aims to uncover the dynamic relationship between lifestyle factors, biological markers, brain training and cognitive performance. Additionally, researchers hope to identify more personalized proposals and practices for promoting brain health. Your involvement in this long-term study will help advance the future of brain health research in the coming years.
Who Is Eligible to Participate?
Adults of any age who are generally neurologically healthy and fluent in English are eligible. Participants must be able to clearly read information on their phone, tablet or computer and be able to adequately hear information that will be presented as sounds. Additional inclusion criteria may apply.
What Will Participants Do?
Most BrainHealth Project participants will complete study activities entirely online. A smaller group will also complete voluntary in-person tasks such as brain imaging. Study activities may include:
The BrainHealth Index
New research-related surveys
Access to online training and education related to brain health
Brain health coaching
MRI brain scan (voluntary MRI Sub-Study, in the Dallas area)
Heart rate variability
Wearable devices
Future study opportunities that may test new interventions and metrics
