The concept of differing cognitive styles has now been established for nearly a century [34]. One proposed classification of cognitive styles distinguishes a rigid or ‘crystalline’ form of intelligence from a flexible or ‘fluid’ style [18]. In this framework, one might conceive of crystalline processes as involving the rigid, rule bound application of factual information, while fluid processes utilize more associative based mechanisms to form novel relationships such as those employed in problem solving and creative thinking.
At a neurophysiological level, fluid cognitive processes appear to be dependent on levels of central aminergic neurotransmitter dominance. Situations of high stress and anxiety, where aminergic transmitter levels are high, impair cognitive flexibility [37], with a particular sensitivity to the degree of dominance by norepinephrine. For example, Beversdorf et al. [6] have established that tests of cognitive flexibility such as anagram word puzzles are completed more quickly following β-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, while task performance worsens following administration of the adrenergic agonist ephedrine. Furthermore, these aminergically controlled changes in cognitive flexibility appear to be centrally as opposed to peripherally mediated [7]. In support of these cognitive data, cellular recordings have demonstrated that a suppression of noradrenergic tone decreases the signal-to-noise ratio within cortical neurons [16], while animal models indicate that reduced firing modes of noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons result in a more divergent state, leading to high degrees of behavioral flexibility [2].
Anatomically, prefrontal lesions and frontal lobe pathology cause severe disruptions to problem solving abilities [4], [10], [12], [27], [38], suggesting that fluid problem-solving abilities entail a reliance upon frontal lobe function during wake. In addition, neuroimaging studies using tasks of cognitive flexibility and fluid reasoning trigger signal increases in prefrontal regions in healthy subjects, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) [28], [32].
Dreaming, a process most strongly correlated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [25], has been associated with enhanced creativity [5]. From the dreams of both August Kekulé which led to the conception of a simple structure for benzene [19], and Dmitry Mendeleyev that initiated the creation of the periodic table of elements [36], to the late night dreaming of Otto Loewi which inspired the creative experiments unveiling neurochemical transmission [24], demonstrations of even scientific creativity arising during sleep do not appear to be uncommon.
Quantitative data have demonstrated that problem solving ability, as measured using fluid cognitive tests, is more effective following a 3.5 h interval containing high proportions of REM sleep in comparison to 3.5 h of waking or non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep [9]. Moreover, a recent study of semantic priming has demonstrated that, in contrast to the situation in waking, performance following REM sleep awakenings shows a greater priming effect by weak primes than by strong primes, while strong priming exceeds weak priming in NREM sleep [35]. While some authors have argued against the concept of such fluid thinking during REM [31], these data support the hypothesis that REM-sleep dreaming may prime the efficiency of more flexible cognitive skills [8], and offer further insights into the hyperassociative and creative processes that have been assigned to the REM-sleep state [14], [24].
During sleep, the brain undergoes dramatic ultradian shifts in neurochemistry and functional neuroanatomy. In NREM sleep, cholinergic systems becomes markedly less active [17], [21], while serotonergic raphé neurons and noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons, although not firing at waking levels, remain active [1], [33], leaving the brain in a more aminergically dominated state. In REM sleep, however, both these aminergic populations are inhibited while the cholinergic system becomes as active as in wake [23], resulting in a brain state that is largely devoid of aminergic modulation. PET studies during REM have revealed that regions of the prefrontal lobe, particularly the DLPFC, become markedly suppressed while limbic systems and posterior regions become more active compared with quiet wake and NREM (for review, see Ref. [22]). Furthermore, following REM awakenings, prefrontal regions do not normalize to baseline levels until 15 min later [3]. In contrast, during deep NREM sleep (stages 3 and 4), most brain regions undergo a decrease in activity compared with wake.
The predictable shifts in neurochemistry, functional neuroanatomy and cognitive-psychological properties occurring in wake, REM and NREM sleep thereby provide a fortuitous model with which to (a) further investigate the dependence of flexible cognitive processes on specific psychophysiological parameters, and (b) gain further clarification of the neurocognitive processes associated with sleep-related mental activity. A summary of the key properties that are proposed to mediate cognitive flexibility are provided in Table 1, together with the changes that occur in these properties during REM and NREM sleep.
This study investigated the difference in cognitive flexibility, using anagram word puzzles, during waking trials and following awakenings from nocturnal REM and NREM sleep. It was hypothesized that waking performance would remain constant across the WAKE trials, while the overall performance following REM awakenings would be greater than that from NREM and WAKE test sessions due to the lack of aminergic dominance and the increases in weak associational networks. Furthermore, it was predicted that, due to the markedly different functional anatomy of REM sleep, specific performance profiles following REM sleep awakenings would be different from both the WAKE and NREM profiles respectively.
