(A) Energy intake was consistently higher during the ultra-processed diet. Data are expressed as mean ± SE.
(B) Average energy intake was increased during the ultra-processed diet because of increased intake of carbohydrate and fat, but not protein. Data are expressed as mean ± SE, and p values are from paired, two-sided t-tests.
(C) Energy consumed at breakfast and lunch was significantly greater during the ultra-processed diet, but energy consumed at dinner and snacks was not significantly different between the diets. Data are expressed as mean ± SE, and p values are from paired, two-sided t-tests.
(D) Both diets were rated similarly on visual analog scales (VASs) with respect to pleasantness and familiarity. Data are expressed as mean ± SE.
(E) Appetitive measures were not significantly different between the diets. Data are expressed as mean ± SE.
(F) Meal eating rate was significantly greater during the ultra-processed diet. Data are expressed as mean ± SE, and p values are from paired, two-sided t-tests.
