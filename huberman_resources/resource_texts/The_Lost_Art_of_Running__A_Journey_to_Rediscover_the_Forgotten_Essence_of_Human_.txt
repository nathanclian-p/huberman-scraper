Shane Benzie is a highly respected movement coach, biomechanics specialist, and best selling author, widely recognised for his pioneering work in the fields of running form and performance enhancement. Drawing on over a decade of research, Shane has developed a unique coaching methodology that blends principles from biomechanics, anatomy, and anthropology. His approach is cantered on the idea of "taking human movement and turning it into human performance”
Benzie has travelled the world to study the movement patterns of some of the most efficient runners, particularly in East Africa, where he has spent considerable time observing elite athletes in places like Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda. His insights have led him to focus on the the fascial system, an amazing elastic system in the body that once tapped into maximises our efficient and dynamic movement. Using a combination of coaching, gait analysis, and cutting-edge technology he works with runners of all levels from amateurs to elite competitors to optimize their performance.
Alongside his research on elite runners Benzie spends time with tribes and indigenous peoples in many different environments including the Amazon, Himalayas, Deserts, Rainforests and Arctic to better understand the cultural effects on our mind and movement.
Shane believes that we learn from extremes which inspires him to work with extreme sports people such free solo climbers, big wave surfers, extreme Kayakers focusing on neuroplasticity and flow state.
To get the best from an athlete Benzie takes a very anthropological view of them, which is inspired by his work around the world with Sharks and Orcas.
His book, The Lost Art of Running, is celebrated for its accessible yet deeply informative take on improving running form. In it, he distills years of research into practical advice, guiding readers through the science and art of running more naturally and efficiently.
In addition to his work as a coach and author, Shane is a sought-after speaker and consultant in the world of endurance sports. His commitment to ongoing research and passion for helping others achieve their goals have earned him a reputation as one of the foremost experts in running biomechanics and movement analysis.
