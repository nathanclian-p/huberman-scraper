What are Circadian Rhythms?
Circadian rhythms are the daily timetables that are present in every cell of every organ in our body, including the brain. Circadian rhythms are the master program that instructs at what time of the day or night every brain chemical, every hormone, every enzyme rises and/or fall. These daily rhythms enable our brain and body to achieve their optimum performance at every hour of the day or night and allow our body to carry out its daily repair and rejuvenation. When we have broken circadian rhythms, the risk for many diseases including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, gut diseases, and cancer goes up. By nurturing our rhythms we can prevent, manage, and even reverse many of these diseases.
