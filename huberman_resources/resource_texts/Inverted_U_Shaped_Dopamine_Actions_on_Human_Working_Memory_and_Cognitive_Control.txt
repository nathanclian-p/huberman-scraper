). In these studies, drug effects were functionally selective, because they did not alter other abilities such as sensorimotor function. In keeping with these findings, administration of the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride, which blocks DA receptor stimulation, impaired performance on several tasks sensitive to PFC function (

). Again, these effects could not be accounted for by nonspecific changes, such as generalized sedative or motoric influences of the drug.
The importance of answering this question stems from two facts. First, DA is of fundamental importance to the etiology of a wide variety of neurobehavioral disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Deficits in working memory and cognitive control are core to these disorders, which are associated with cognitive inflexibility, impulsivity, and/or compulsivity. Moreover, DA drugs are used widely in the treatment of a variety of brain disorders and to a lesser extent in the treatment of psychostimulant addiction. Although it should be important to understand the cognitive effects of any drug that is commonly prescribed, it is especially important in the case of drugs used to treat disorders with cognitive deficits. In addition, even acute and/or mild stress and fatigue can lead the mind to be inflexible or unfocused. Accumulating evidence from research with monkeys has revealed that the catecholamines (DA and noradrenaline [NA]) play an important role in these normal states (
12
12.
Arnsten, A.F.T.
Catecholamine modulation of prefrontal cortical cognitive function
Trends Cogn Sci.
1998;
2
:436-446
). Thus, a better understanding of DA function will advance not only the treatment development for and understanding of the abnormal mind but also that of the usually adaptive but at times inflexible unfocused healthy mind. The high concentration of DA receptors in the PFC and strongly connected structures gives us a leverage point for studying normal and disordered brain function. Different dopaminergic agents provide different selectivity profiles, on the basis of their actions on different DA receptors, and it will be valuable to understand both the behavioral and neural effects of these drugs.
Second, the questions we raise are motivated at a theoretical level by basic questions about the neurobiological basis of higher cognitive function. How does DA contribute to higher cognitive functions like working memory and cognitive control? Which brain areas mediate these contributions? Which cognitive functions are served by dopaminergic pathways and the cortical regions they innervate?
Here we review two methodological approaches to studying the effects of DA on human cognition—administration of DA receptor agents to healthy subjects and controlled withdrawal of dopaminergic medication in patients with PD.
Variability in Basal DA Levels in the PFC of Nonhuman Animals
What might be the origin of these performance-dependent effects of dopaminergic drug administration? Accumulating evidence from research with mice, rats, and monkeys indicates that it likely reflects variability in baseline levels of DA, specifically in the PFC (

) have shown in rats that poor performance on a difficult (working) memory task (with a long delay) was accompanied by low DA levels in the PFC, whereas good performance on an easy task (with a shorter delay) was accompanied by high DA levels in the PFC. Interestingly, performance on the difficult task was improved by administration of a DA D1 receptor agonist, whereas good performance on the easy task was impaired (

In contrast, a D1 receptor agonist improved performance in aged monkeys but not in young monkeys. Furthermore, stress-induced working memory deficits were ameliorated by pretreatment with DA receptor antagonists. This finding suggests that excessive DA release in the PFC during stress led to the observed working memory deficits (

) demonstrated that the effect of a D1 receptor antagonist on delay period activity was dose-dependent and highly selective for PFC neurons with memory fields for particular locations. Cellular mechanisms underlying these effects of DA receptor stimulation have been proposed, on the basis of in vitro recordings, to include: 1) increased impact of the
N
-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) component of excitatory synaptic input onto PFC neurons, thought to be essential for the maintenance of current PFC activity (

2001;
21
:3628-3638
). These cellular mechanisms might lead to an increased signal-to-noise ratio, and a “quelling” of activity in all but the most strongly active cell assemblies. This would result in a single strengthened working memory representation resistant to subsequent inputs. With supra-optimal receptor stimulation, this “quelling” of activity would take on excessive forms, thus leading to a blocking of all new input to the PFC, corresponding with perseverative responding and severe working memory impairment. These ideas are quite similar to a more abstract proposal from approximately 20 years ago, according to which DA induced changes in the gain of neuronal input/output functions (

Recent in vitro recordings have suggested a mechanism by which DA might induce changes in the gain of neuronal input/output in an “Inverted-U” shaped manner (

Dopamine modulates persistent synaptic activity and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in the prefrontal cortex
PLoS One.

4
:e6507
). Administration of exogenous DA to these cultures altered PFC activity in a DA concentration-dependent fashion. Thus, in VTA-containing cultures (which possessed a tonic DA level and where stimulation of the VTA evoked DA transients within the PFC), high DA concentrations reduced spontaneous network activity (i.e., up-states) and diminished excitatory synaptic inputs evoked during the down-state. Conversely, low DA concentrations had no effect on spontaneous network activity in these VTA-containing cultures, but selectively increased the efficiency of a train of excitatory synaptic inputs to evoke spikes during the up-state. Critically, when background DA was eliminated, spontaneous network activity (i.e., up-states) could be enhanced by low concentrations of DA. These findings highlight the importance of considering how DA can modulate the input and output of individual neurons but also the effects of these neurons embedded in an active network.
The biophysical mechanisms underlying the supra-optimal effect of DA receptor stimulation are not known. According to one hypothesis, excitatory NMDA effects might dominate at lower stimulation levels, whereas inhibitory GABA
A
effects might dominate at higher DA activation levels (

The hypothesis that excessive D1 receptor stimulation in the PFC blocks new input concurs with neurophysiological data from monkeys (

Inverted-U dopamine D1 receptor actions on prefrontal neurons engaged in working memory
Nat Neurosci.
2007;
10
:176-184
). In this study monkeys engaged in an oculomotor delayed response task, while spatially tuned delay-related activity was measured in terms of the difference between firing to preferred and nonpreferred directions. An inverted-U–shaped response to D1 receptor stimulation was observed in terms of spatial tuning, but this was a consequence of suppression of delay-related activity in both low and high doses. It was only after the high dose that firing was suppressed in both preferred as well as nonpreferred directions. Thus, whereas low levels of D1 receptor stimulation improved working memory tuning by suppressing only task-irrelevant representations, high levels of D1 receptor stimulation impaired working memory tuning by suppressing delay-related firing for both relevant as well as irrelevant representations. Like the human studies, this study revealed that these effects depended on the baseline state of the unit, in this case the neuron: iontophoresis of a low-dose D1 receptor agonist on weakly tuned cells unmasked spatial activity by suppressing only noisy task-irrelevant activity, whereas spatial tuning was less improved or even worsened in strongly tuned cells. Iontophoretic pharmacology revealed that these suppressive effects of D1 receptor stimulation depended on the second-messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway. It might be noted that this in vivo study did not find any evidence for the excitatory actions of D1 receptor stimulation on PFC activity, reported by in vitro studies (see preceding text). One possibility is that these excitatory actions of the D1 receptor, detected in vitro, are already fully engaged by endogenous DA in vivo. Thus, the apparent discrepancy between the in vitro slice studies and the in vivo recordings from cognitively engaged monkeys is that the pyramidal cell recurrent excitation is absent in the former but predominating in the latter. In any case, the finding that DA-induced improvements of spatial tuning are accompanied by suppressive effects on PFC activity concurs with the general observation from human functional imaging studies that working memory improvement after DA-enhancing drug administration is accompanied by reductions in PFC activity (

Baseline-Dependent Mechanisms of DA Action in Humans
So far we have seen that dopaminergic drug effects in nonhuman animals vary as a function of baseline levels of DA in the PFC. Is there evidence for similar baseline dependency of dopaminergic drug effects in humans? One source of such evidence comes from studies of drug effects that take into account genetic differences between individuals (see for review [

One of the best-studied polymorphisms is the Val

Met polymorphism in the catechol-

-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. Catechol-
O
-methyltransferase is an enzyme that breaks down DA released into the synaptic gap between two neurons and is thought to have a much greater influence on DA levels in the PFC than in the striatum (

). This regional specificity derives from the observation that DA transporters are less abundant in the PFC than in the striatum, so that DA metabolism in the PFC would depend more readily on enzymatic degradation by COMT than on transport and reuptake by the DA transporter. Relatively little COMT activity would imply more DA in the synapse (and more action at DA receptors on the receiving neuron), whereas relatively greater COMT activity would imply less DA in the synapse. In the general population there are two common variants of the gene determining COMT levels. Individuals with the Val-allele have relatively high COMT activity and presumably low baseline DA; conversely, individuals with the Met-allele have relatively low COMT activity and presumably high baseline DA. Consistent with these assumptions are findings that individuals with the Met-allele (high DA) perform significantly better on tasks requiring cognitive control and working memory than those with the Val variant (

). Accordingly, these genetic studies suggest that, as in the case of nonhuman animals, dopaminergic drug effects in humans also depend on baseline levels of DA.
These genetic studies, however, do not provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that performance-dependent effects of dopaminergic drugs reflect baseline levels of DA. Thus, there is no definitive evidence that Val-carriers have lower baseline levels of DA in the PFC, and the functionality of the Taq1A polymorphism is controversial. Direct measurements of DA transmission in humans can be made only with neurochemical positron emission tomography (PET), although most applications of this method are limited to visualizing striatal DA, not being optimized for detecting DA levels in the PFC. We have recently employed this technique with the radiotracer 6-[
18
F] fluoro-L-m-tyrosine (FMT) to quantify individual differences in the degree to which DA is synthesized in the terminals of midbrain DA neurons. In this study, subjects with high and low working memory capacity underwent an FMT PET scan (
Figure 2
). Intriguingly, subjects with low working memory capacity had significantly lower DA synthesis capacity in the striatum than subjects with high working memory capacity (

), in whom striatal DA synthesis capacity predicted not only working memory capacity but also PFC activity during working memory performance. Therefore, these data provided the first direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that the dependency of dopaminergic drug effects on baseline working memory capacity reflects differential baseline levels of DA function. Even more direct evidence for this hypothesis came from the finding that the effects of the DA receptor agonist bromocriptine could also be predicted from baseline levels of DA synthesis capacity in the striatum (

). Specifically, we found that healthy young individuals with low DA synthesis (and working memory) capacity benefited from bromocriptine, whereas subjects with high DA synthesis (and working memory) capacity were impaired by the same drug. Thus, individual variability in dopaminergic drug effects on human cognition reflected individual variability in basal levels of DA.

These observations from human studies are remarkably consistent with those reported in experimental animals, reviewed in the preceding text. Indeed, the literature converges across species, except for one noteworthy aspect: although animal work has highlighted the role of basal DA levels specifically in the PFC, human PET work has revealed an important role for basal DA in a different brain region (i.e., the striatum). A critical role for the striatum in DA function is not surprising, given that dopaminergic projections are strongest and receptors most abundant in the striatum as well as given the existence of strong anatomical connections between the PFC and the striatum in so-called frontostriatal circuits (

).
Although it remains possible that PET measurements of striatal DA transmission are an index of DA levels in PFC (which cannot be easily detected with PET imaging), the human PET work does raise an alternative hypothesis. Specifically the baseline-dependent effects of DA on PFC function might reflect modulation of frontostriatal connectivity, which varies as a function of basal DA levels in the striatum rather than in the PFC. To test this hypothesis, we recently investigated the effect of bromocriptine administration to healthy individuals on functional interactions between the PFC and striatum (

), we found that, during the engagement of working memory retrieval processes, bromocriptine increased frontostriatal connectivity in individuals with low working memory capacity, corresponding with performance improvement. In contrast, individuals with high working memory capacity exhibited a decrease in frontostriatal connectivity after bromocriptine administration, corresponding with worsened performance. Such effects of bromocriptine might reflect direct action at the level of the striatum or, alternatively, stimulation of D2 receptors on layer V cells in the PFC, which project to the striatum.
The difference between animal and human studies in terms of emphasis on basal levels of DA in the PFC versus the striatum might reflect one or more of multiple factors. First, the only method available and used so far for studying human DA transmission directly is PET, which is optimized for detecting signals in the striatum. Signals in the PFC are generally weak for most applications. Second, human studies have primarily investigated effects of DA drugs that have the greatest affinity for the D2 receptor family, partly due to the lack of D1-selective drugs available for human research. The D2 receptors are more abundant in the striatum than in the PFC (

). Finally, human studies have employed cognitive paradigms that require different cognitive operations from those required for paradigms employed in animal studies. For example, demands for the flexible updating of current goal representations (which might be more dependent on striatal function; see following) have generally been higher in human cognitive paradigms than in animal paradigms, the latter often focusing on the delay period of working memory tests (but see [

]). The nature of the required cognitive operation might determine the degree to which DA levels in the striatum or in the PFC are predictive of drug effects.
Distinct Roles for Striatal and PFC DA
Traditionally, cognitive effects of DA are ascribed to modulation of the PFC. However, recent theories as well as empiric data have highlighted a complementary role for DA in the striatum in working memory and cognitive control (

). According to recent ideas, the functional role of DA in the striatum might be qualitatively different from that of DA in the PFC, extending beyond the persistent stabilization of information. Specifically, striatal DA might rather be more important for the ability to flexibly update those goal representations when new information becomes available, for example, as measured during the encoding and probe period of the delayed response task. Empirical and computational work has indeed suggested that such updating during the encoding and probe periods of the delayed response task is not modulated by D1 receptor stimulation in the PFC but rather by D2 receptor stimulation (

An interesting observation is that updating and stabilization can be conceptualized as representing functionally opposing processes. If we update too readily, then we are likely to get distracted, rendering our behavior unstable. Conversely, if our representations are overly persistent or stable, then there is a danger of inflexibility and unresponsiveness to new information. A pure form of reciprocity would imply that we need only a single mechanism that can be adjusted dynamically, depending on task demands. However, we often need to be both flexible and persistent at the same time, at least at the global level. Thus, although we should be flexible in response to task-relevant changes, we should be simultaneously stable as long as the changes are irrelevant. To resolve this apparent paradox, it is more plausible to postulate two separate mechanisms that nevertheless work together. The need for two separate mechanisms is also illustrated by the observation that various disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, are accompanied by a combination of inflexible as well as unstable behavior and distractibility. Empirical data support the hypothesis that these two separate mechanisms might be subserved by DA in the striatum and by DA in the PFC, respectively. For example, Roberts

). Specifically, that study revealed that DA lesions in the PFC led to enhanced distractibility (poor attentional set maintenance), although DA lesions in the striatum actually reduced distractibility (enhanced attentional set maintenance). Thus, the contrasting effects on set maintenance might well underlie the contrasting changes measured in the subsequent attentional set shifting stages of the task. These opposing effects of striatal and frontal DA lesions underline the possible competition between the PFC and the striatum (

). One implication of this model is that stability and flexibility trade off in the healthy brain, where DA levels interact dynamically. Thus, optimal DA levels in the PFC might be good for stability but bad for flexibility, whereas optimal DA levels in the striatum might be good for flexibility but bad for stability. Note that, according to this model, supra-optimal levels of DA in the PFC would potentiate stabilization to its extreme, thus inducing perseveration, whereas supra-optimal levels of DA in the striatum would potentiate flexible updating to its extreme, thus inducing distractibility.
This working hypothesis is reminiscent of the dual-state theory put forward recently by Durstewitz and Seamans (

), which is grounded in in vitro neurophysiology and biophysically realistic computational modeling work. Prefrontal cortex networks can be, according to this theory, either in a D1-dominated state—which is characterized by a high-energy barrier favoring robust stabilization of representations—or in a D2-dominated state—which is characterized by a low-energy barrier favoring fast flexible switching between representations. Consistent with this proposal are findings that D2 receptor agonists act in opposite ways to D1 receptor agonists, at least in vitro, on NMDA and GABA currents, neuronal excitability, as well as on cAMP production (

): in the D2-dominated state, “the valleys of the energy landscape become so flat and nearby that noise might easily push the system from one state into the other.” According to the theory, this D2-state corresponds with a state that facilitates flexible updating of goal representations in response to new inputs and contrasts or even competes with a D1-state that facilitates stabilization, eventually eliciting perseveration due to excessive blockade of new input. Although it is clear that D1 and D2 receptor action can be synergistic as well as antagonistic, this hypothesis is corroborated by findings in humans that the DA D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride (shown to modulate brain activity in the striatum [

]). This alternative receptor-based theory is not necessarily inconsistent with our working hypothesis, according to which DA in the striatum and the PFC subserve the distinct roles of updating and stabilization, respectively. Indeed, D2 receptors are more abundant in the striatum than in the PFC, which contains fewer D2 than D1 receptors (

As stated in the preceding text, one implication of this model is that different functions require distinct levels of DA in different brain regions: high DA levels in the PFC might be good for stabilization but bad for flexible updating. Conversely, high DA levels in the striatum might be good for flexible updating but bad for stabilization. On the basis of this hypothesis, we might expect that natural genetic variations affecting DA primarily in the PFC but not in the striatum (e.g., between those of us with the Val and Met versions of the COMT gene) confer both behavioral costs as well as behavioral benefits (see also [

) have confirmed that individuals with the Met allele, who have repeatedly been shown to perform better on working memory tasks that require cognitive stabilization, also exhibit impaired performance on tasks of flexible updating, compared with Val individuals. These data further strengthen the working hypothesis that increases in DA might have paradoxical consequences for distinct cognitive functions, reflecting functional specificity of the effects of DA in the PFC.
Consistent with this notion that distinct brain regions might mediate different effects of DA are findings from a recent study that demonstrated that DA receptor stimulation modulated the PFC or the striatum depending on task demands (

). In this pharmacological fMRI study, young healthy individuals were scanned on two occasions, once after administration of bromocriptine and once after placebo while performing a working memory task. In this task, subjects had to encode, maintain, and retrieve visual stimuli. Four such stimuli (two faces and two scenes) were presented during the encoding period, which was followed by a delay period during which subjects had to maintain the relevant stimuli in memory. After this initial delay period, another stimulus was presented, which subjects were instructed to ignore. This distractor was either a scrambled image (the nondistractor) or a novel face or scene (the congruent distractor). It was followed by a second delay, after which subjects were probed to respond with the right or left finger, depending on whether the probe stimulus matched one of the two task-relevant encoding stimuli (
Figure 3
A). Critically, subjects were instructed on each trial to attend to either the faces or the scenes. If the fixation cross was blue, they had to memorize the faces; if it was green, they had to memorize the scenes. The blue face trials and the green scene trials were randomized within blocks, enabling the measurement of the flexible switching of attention between faces and scenes. The critical measure of flexible updating—which was predicted to depend on striatal function—was the switch-cost, which was calculated by subtracting performance (error rates and reaction times measured at probe) on nonswitch trials from that on switch trials. The critical measure of stabilization—which was predicted to depend on PFC function—was the distractor-cost, calculated by subtracting performance (measured at probe) after scrambled nondistractors from that after congruent distractors. We had two predictions. First, bromocriptine would modulate PFC activity during cognitive stabilization (as a function of distractor-type) but striatal activity during flexible updating (as a function of attention switching). Second, we predicted that effects of bromocriptine would depend on baseline levels of DA. Bromocriptine would remedy function of brain regions with low baseline levels of DA, while detrimentally overdosing function of brain regions with already optimized baseline levels of DA.

). BG, basal ganglia.
To investigate individual differences in baseline levels of DA, we assessed drug effects separately in two groups of subjects that differed in their baseline working memory capacity, as measured with the listening span test. The results were consistent with our hypotheses: bromocriptine modulated distinct brain regions, the striatum and the lateral PFC, during flexible updating (switching) and stabilization (distractor-resistance), respectively (
Figure 3
B). Critically, these effects depended on individual differences in working memory capacity. Specifically, bromocriptine improved flexible updating in the low-span subjects but impaired flexible updating in the high-span subjects. Bromocriptine significantly potentiated striatal activity during updating in the low-span subjects, yet nonsignificantly attenuated striatal activity during updating in the high-span subjects. Thus, a drug-induced improvement in updating was accompanied by a drug-induced potentiation of striatal activity in the low-span subjects. Conversely, a drug-induced (nonsignificant) impairment in updating was accompanied by a drug-induced (nonsignificant) attenuation of striatal activity in the high-span subjects. We also assessed updating-related activity in the lateral PFC. As predicted, the lateral PFC was not modulated by bromocriptine during updating. Importantly, lateral PFC activity was modulated by bromocriptine during the delay period of the task when distracting stimuli were present (i.e., during stabilization). Specifically, PFC activity was potentiated by bromocriptine in the low-span subjects, while remaining unaltered in the high-span subjects. Similar effects were not observed in the striatum. Together, these data concur with the hypothesis that flexible updating and stabilization are mediated by dopaminergic modulation of the striatum and the PFC, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of bromocriptine were not only regionally specific as a function of task demands but also baseline-dependent, as illustrated by the opposite effects in high- and low-span subjects.
It might be noted that this functional and regional specificity of dopaminergic drug effects might also account for some apparent discrepancy between effects of the relatively specific D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine and the mixed DA D1/D2 receptor agonist pergolide. For example, we have previously revealed that the relationship between baseline working memory capacity and pergolide in young healthy volunteers (

) is opposite to the one described in the preceding text for bromocriptine. Thus, although low-span subjects benefited more from bromocriptine than high-span subjects, we have also reported and replicated that the effect of a single dose of pergolide in young healthy subjects was more beneficial for subjects with greater working memory capacity (

). This apparent discrepancy between the effects of pergolide and bromocriptine might well be due to differential selectivity of the drugs for D1 and D2 receptors, respectively, the resulting differential (frontal vs. striatal) site of modulation and the differential performance measure. Thus, the effects of bromocriptine and their dependency on span in the 1997 and 2007 studies were observed on tasks requiring some form of flexible updating, implicating the striatum, and not for the delayed response tasks. Conversely, the effects of pergolide and their effects on span in the 2003 and 2006 studies were restricted to the delayed response tasks, presumably implicating primarily the PFC, and not extending to the task-switching paradigm (

). On the basis of known neurochemical reciprocity and our observation that the listening span correlates positively with DA synthesis capacity in the striatum, we might hypothesize that the relationship between listening span and drug effects is positive for PFC function (i.e., stabilization) but negative for striatal function (i.e., flexible updating).
PD Studies Strengthen the Link Between DA and Cognition
A different approach toward assessing the influence of DA on cognitive function in humans is by testing patients with PD. Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative movement disorder and characterized by a spatiotemporal progression of nigrostriatal and mesocortical DA depletion. In addition to deficits in motor control, PD is also accompanied by significant cognitive impairments even in the early stages of the disease. Central nervous system levels of DA can be manipulated over short periods by withdrawing the normal regimen of DA replacement drugs (i.e., levodopa), because the half-life of these drugs is relatively short. Effects can be easily monitored by observing deterioration in the motor status of the patient.
Many studies have obtained findings with this method by testing PD patients on tasks thought to be sensitive to PFC dysfunction (

For example, impairments are seen on the Tower of London planning task, spatial working memory tests, and a test of attentional set-shifting (

). Because of this spatiotemporal progression of DA depletion, mild PD provides a good model for understanding the regionally selective and baseline-dependent role of DA in distinct brain regions (e.g., the striatum versus the PFC).
In particular, PD might be predicted to be accompanied by an inflexible state—due to low striatal DA levels—that is, however, also abnormally stable—due to high frontal DA levels. Evidence for the first part of this hypothesis, namely impairments in flexible updating, is overwhelming. Set-shifting difficulties have been shown on a variety of task ranging from WCST-like discrimination learning tasks to more rapid task-switching paradigms (

) and therefore cannot be accounted for by global effects on motor symptoms, arousal, and/or motivation.
To test the second part of our hypothesis (i.e., that mild PD patients exhibit paradoxically enhanced cognitive stabilization), we investigated PD patients, once on and once off their normal dopaminergic medication on the delayed response task described in the preceding text (

). As expected, medication withdrawal significantly worsened their movement symptoms. Intriguingly, there was also a significant difference between patients not taking their medication and control subjects in terms of the distractor-cost. Specifically, patients not taking medication exhibited paradoxically reduced distractor-costs (i.e., enhanced stabilization), compared with control subjects, who responded more slowly after a congruent distractor than after a scrambled nondistractor. Thus, when they were not taking their medication, patients were less distracted by the congruent distractor during the delay than control subjects. This pattern of performance of the patients in their nonmedicated state was particularly striking, given their significantly increased motor symptoms. Furthermore, the reduced distractor-cost was normalized when the same patients were tested while taking their normal dopaminergic medication, so that the distractor-cost of the patients no longer differed from that of control subjects when they were receiving medication.
These data confirm that the DA-depleted state of PD is accompanied by changes in cognitive control. However, PD seems to confer either deficits or benefits, depending on the precise task demands under study. Although they suffer enhanced switch-costs (i.e., impaired flexible updating), they also show reduced distractibility (i.e., enhanced stabilization). We hypothesize—on the basis of their anatomical pattern of DA depletion, the fMRI data reviewed in the preceding text (
Figure 3
), and the resemblance of the performance pattern to that seen in monkeys with striatal DA lesions (

)—that the combination of poor flexibility and good stability in PD patients not taking medication reflects depletion of striatal DA and upregulation of DA in the PFC, respectively. An intriguing possibility is that the restoration of switch- and distractor-costs by dopaminergic medication reflects a normalization of the balance between frontal and striatal DA.
