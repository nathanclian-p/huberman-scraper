Abstract
Growing evidence suggests that sleep plays an important role in the process
 of procedural learning. Most recently, sleep has been implicated in the
 continued development of motor-skill learning following initial acquisition.
 However, the temporal evolution of motor learning before and after sleep, the
 effects of different training regimens, and the long-term development of motor
 learning across multiple nights of sleep remain unknown. Here, we report data
 for subjects trained and retested on a sequential finger-tapping task across
 multiple days. The findings demonstrate firstly that following initial
 training, small practice-dependent improvements are possible before, but not
 following the large practice-independent gains that develop across a night of
 sleep. Secondly, doubling the quantity of initial training does not alter the
 amount of subsequent sleep-dependent learning that develops overnight.
 Thirdly, the amount of sleep-dependent learning does not correlate with the
 amount of practice-dependent learning achieved during training, suggesting the
 existence of two discrete motor-learning processes. Finally, whereas the
 majority of sleep-dependent motor-skill learning develops during the first
 night of sleep following training, additional nights of sleep still offer
 continued improvements.
Evidence from animal and human studies continues to suggest that the
 brain-state of sleep plays an important role in the process of memory
 formation. In humans, sleep has been most consistently implicated in the
 development of procedural learning (i.e., perceptual and motor skills),
 specifically in the ongoing process of memory consolidation, following the
 initial stage of memory acquisition (
Karni
 et al. 1994
;
Gais et al.
 2000
; Stickgold et al.
2000a
,
b
;
Walker et al. 2002
).
Several different factors are considered to be important in procedural
 memory formation. One critical element is the amount of training or practice
 during task acquisition, which strongly influences both behavioral learning
 (
Karni et al. 1995
;
Karni and Bertini 1997
;
Rattoni and Escobar 2000
) and
 functional brain changes (
Karni et al.
 1995
;
Jancke et al.
 2001
). It is widely accepted that, following effective
 acquisition, a specific memory representation is formed, which can then
 undergo further modification during the process of consolidation.
The process of consolidation was initially believed to evolve in a
 time-dependent manner (
Brashers-Krug et al.
 1996
;
Karni et al.
 1998
;
McGaugh
 2000
). However, this concept has been refined recently, with
 several studies suggesting that, in addition to sufficient practice during
 acquisition (which is usually accompanied by rapid learning within the
 session), posttraining consolidation offers a second, delayed stage of
 learning that develops in the absence of further training. But instead of
 evolving simply as a function of time per se, this delayed improvement
 develops exclusively across periods of sleep and not wake for certain forms of
 learning (
Karni et al. 1994
;
Gais et al. 2000
; Stickgold et
 al.
2000a
,
b
;
Fischer et al. 2002
;
Walker et al. 2002
).
For example, in the visual domain, Karni et al.
 (
1994
) have demonstrated that,
 following training, delayed learning of a texture discrimination task occurs
 during a night of sleep, and that selective disruption of rapid eye movement
 (REM) sleep prevents this overnight performance gain. Using the same task,
 Stickgold and colleagues have shown firstly that learning of this task does
 not benefit from periods of 3–12 h of wake following the acquisition
 stage of memory formation (
Stickgold et
 al. 2000b
), whereas sleep triggers significant additional
 performance improvements, with the overnight benefits correlating strongly
 with the amount of slow-wave sleep (SWS; combined stage-III and stage-IV NREM
 sleep) early in the night, as well as the amount of REM sleep late in the
 night (
Stickgold et al.
 2000b
). Stickgold and colleagues have also demonstrated that
 delayed performance benefits are absolutely dependent on the first night of
 sleep after acquisition (
Stickgold et al.
 2000a
). Also following training on this same visual skill task,
 Gais et al. (
2000
) selectively
 deprived subjects of sleep early in the night (rich in SWS) or late in the
 night (rich in REM sleep), and concluded that enhanced memory consolidation is
 triggered by SWS-related processes, whereas REM sleep promotes additional
 consolidation, but only after periods of SWS sleep
 (
Gais et al. 2000
).
Several lines of evidence have also identified delayed motor-skill learning
 that is sleep, and not just time dependent. First, Walker et al.
 (
2002
), have described
 evidence of sleep-dependent learning in the motor system using a sequential
 finger-tapping task. Subjects were trained either in the morning or evening
 and retested at subsequent 12-h intervals following wake or sleep. Although
 practice on the motor-skill task improved performance within the training
 session for all groups equally, regardless of time of day, subjects trained in
 the morning demonstrated no significant improvement in speed when retested
 after 12 h of wake. In contrast, they showed an average 20% improvement by the
 next morning, following a night of sleep. Subjects who were instead trained in
 the evening, demonstrated large and significant improvements in performance
 overnight, just 12-h posttraining, but showed no significant additional
 learning after a further 12 h of wake. Thus, significant delayed improvement
 was only seen across a night of sleep and not over a similar period of wake,
 regardless of whether the time awake or time asleep came first. Second, when
 the degree of overnight improvement in motor learning was correlated with
 sleep recordings, a significant positive correlation was found with the
 percentage of stage-II NREM sleep, particularly late in the night, further
 implicating sleep in the observed learning effect. Third, similar data by
 Fischer et al. (
2002
) have
 recently confirmed the findings of Walker et al.
 (
2002
), with the additional
 evidence that, as with visual skill learning
 (
Stickgold et al. 2000a
),
 sleep on the first night following training is critical for the delayed
 improvement to develop, and that sleep during the day triggers similar
 improvements to those achieved following nocturnal sleep.
Thus, practice clearly improves performance within a session on certain
 tasks, whereas sleep triggers an additional consolidation phase in the absence
 of further task engagement. Building on these previous findings, we now
 describe the nature and time course of this procedural motor-skill learning,
 and examine the relationship between practice-dependent and delayed
 sleep-dependent motor learning.
Four specific questions are addressed in this study: (1) After an initial
 training session, are there differences in the profile of motor skill learning
 across the first 12 h of wake prior to a night of sleep compared with the
 profile of motor-skill learning across the 12 h of wake following a subsequent
 night of sleep? (2) How does a second full training session affect subsequent
 overnight sleep-dependent learning? (3) How does improvement after three
 nights of sleep compare with one night of sleep? (4) Is the amount of delayed,
 sleep-dependent learning correlated with the earlier, rapid,
 practice-dependent learning?
RESULTS
Practice-Dependent Learning During Training
The forty subjects in groups 1–4 were trained on the finger-skill
 task at either 10 AM or 1 PM on day 1, with the learning curves for each group
 displayed in
Figure 1
.
Figure 1.
Improvement in performance speed across training. Improvement during
 training session 1 (trials 1–12) was similar for subjects trained at 10
 AM (group 1, □) and 1 PM (groups 2 and 4, ⋄; and group 3, •).
 Subjects in group 3 performed a second successive training session (trials
 13–24), demonstrating modest continued improvements, similar to the
 predicted improvement rate based on the logarithmic regression across the
 first 12 trials of training in Session 1 (broken line).
Training Session 1
Improvement in performance across the first 12-trial training session
 (Session One) was similar for all groups, with no significant difference in
 performance speed between the posttraining score (ave. trials 10–12) at
 10 AM or 1 PM (t[38] = 0.19,
P
= 0.84) or in the baseline starting
 level (trial 1; t[38] = 0.13,
P
= 0.89). When averaged across these
 groups, there was an improvement in performance speed of 7.8 sequences (52%)
 during the 12 trials of training. The majority of this learning occurred
 across the first 3 trials (4.88 sequences; 32.4% or 1.6 seq/trial), with the
 remaining 3.0 sequences (19.7%) developing across the final 10 trials (or 0.33
 seq/trial;
Fig. 1
). On the
 basis of the learning curve across the 12 trials of Session One, a projected
 logarithmic fit, extending an additional 12 trials (13–24) could be
 extrapolated for additional tests to predict the expected performance-rate
 improvements following continued rehearsal
 (
Fig. 1
; broken line). There
 was also a significant 47% decrease in error rate across the 12 training
 trials of Session One (0.29 errors/seq during Trial 1 vs. 0.15/seq during
 Trial 12; t[39] = 2.61,
P
= 0.01).
Training Session 2
Following a 10-min rest period after Session One, subjects in group 4
 received a second training session (Session Two). Subjects showed small, but
 significant continued incremental increases in performance speed, improving by
 a total of just 2.0 sequences across the additional 12 trials, from 23.7 to
 25.7 sequences (8.44% or 0.17 seq/trial, r = 0.67, df = 11,
P
= 0.01;
Fig. 1
). As can be seen from
Figure 1
, the learning benefit
 achieved across Session Two was similar to the extrapolated/predicted
 improvement rate on the basis of the initial 12 trials across training Session
 One (
Fig. 1
, broken line).
 There was no significant difference between the predicted improvement based on
 the continued rehearsal rate of 0.33 seq/trial during the final 10 trials of
 training in Session One, and the actual improvement obtained by subjects
 across Session Two (t[9] = 1.60, p = 0.14). There was also no significant
 difference between performance on the final trial of Session One (Trial 12;
 23.8 seq/trial) and the first trial of Session Two (Trial 13; 23.7 seq/trial)
 following the 10-min rest period (t[9] = 0.15,
P
= 0.88). In contrast
 to the modest increase in speed, there was no significant reduction in error
 rate across Session Two (0.16 for Trial 13 vs. 0.14 for Trial 24; t[9] = 0.53,
P
= 0.60).
Group 1: Motor Skill Learning Across 36 h (
n
= 10)
To investigate differences in the profile of continued motor-skill learning
 across periods of wake prior to a night of sleep compared with periods of wake
 following a night of sleep, subjects in group 1
 (
Fig. 5
, below) were training
 at 10 AM day 1, and retested at 2, 6, and 10 PM later that same day (elapsed
 time = 4–12 h). Then, following a night of sleep, subjects were retested
 again across the subsequent waking period of day 2 at 10 AM, 2, 6, and 10 PM
 (time = 24–36 h).
Figure 5.
Training-dependent learning vs. sleep-dependent learning. Subjects were
 trained once and retested once after a single intervening night of sleep
 (
n
= 25; groups 2 and 5). (
A
) Speed: There was no
 relationship between the amount of improvement during training (difference
 between baseline and posttraining score) and the amount of subsequent
 overnight improvements (difference between posttraining and retest score).
 (
B
) Error rate: Similarly, there was no evidence of a correlation
 between practice-dependent changes in error rate during training, and the
 amount of continued performance improvements in error rate that developed
 overnight.
Speed
There was a significant difference in performance speed across the 36-h
 period (F[7,72] = 2.59,
P
= 0.01;
Fig. 2A
). Following training,
 subjects demonstrated a significant linear increase in performance at each
 retest across the first 12 h of wake on day 1
 (
Fig. 2A
, solid black bars;
 F[4,45] = 8.06,
P
< 0.001), improving by an average of 1.1
 sequences per retest, or 0.37 seq/trial. These incremental gains in
 performance speed across day 1 were not significantly different from the
 expected rehearsal-based improvement extrapolated from the final 10 trials of
 training (paired t-tests,
t
> 0.18,
P
> 0.4 for each
 time,
t
= 1.3,
P
> 0.2 for all times combined). Thus,
 with continued retesting across day 1 prior to sleep, there was a modest,
 linear improvement in performance speed, similar to that predicted by
 rehearsal alone.
Figure 2.
Differential motor skill learning across 36 h before and after sleep (Group
 1). (
A
) Speed. Following training at 10 AM, subjects demonstrated
 modest, but significant continued gains in motor-skill speed with rehearsal on
 day 1 (solid black bars). The initial retest on day 2 (RT4) showed a large and
 significant overnight improvement. In contrast, continued retesting across day
 2 (hatched bars) yielded no further increase in performance speed. The marked
 difference in learning profiles prior to sleep (day 1) and following sleep
 (day 2) are seen in the improvement slopes for each group (broken lines; day 1
 slope [presleep] = 1.08 vs. day 2 slope [postsleep] = 0.14). (
B
)
 Error rate. In contrast, error rate did not significantly improve during
 daytime rehearsal on either day 1 (solid bars) or day 2 (hatched bars), with
 the only significant decrease in error rate occurring exclusively across the
 night of intervening sleep. This similarity is evident in the comparable
 learning profile slopes prior to sleep on day 1 and following sleep on day 2
 (broken lines; day 1 slope [presleep] = 0.009 vs. day-2 slope [postsleep] =
 0.001). (PT) Posttraining value (average of final three trials of training);
 (RT) retest value (average of three trials); Error bars, SEM; (Asterisks)
 significance (P) compared with previous time point at *<0.05;
 **<0.005
Although these subjects displayed large significant improvements overnight
 (see below), continued retesting across day 2 resulted in no additional
 performance gains at 2, 6, or 10 PM (
Fig.
 2A
, hatched bars; F[3,36] = 0.01,
P
= 0.99). The
 differences in learning profiles prior to sleep (day 1) and following sleep
 (day 2) are demonstrated by the performance slopes for each day in
Figure 2A
. When the performance
 slopes across the four time points on day 1 and day 2 were compared
 (
Fig. 2A
; broken lines
 representing the linear approximation fit), there was a significant difference
 between the rate of improvement in performance on presleep day 1 compared with
 the postsleep performance profile on day 2 (t[9] = 3.09,
P
= 0.01)
 suggesting that, following the overnight gains in motor-skill speed, no
 subsequent rehearsal-dependent learning occurred on day 2.
In agreement with our previous findings (see below), a comparison of the
 final retest performance prior to sleep on day 1 (RT3, 10 PM) with the first
 retest the next morning (RT4, 10 AM) revealed a significant increase in
 learning overnight (t[9] = 4.33,
P
= 0.001;
Fig. 2A
).
Error Rate
There was also a significant difference in error rate across the 36-h
 period (F[7,72] = 2.10,
P
< 0.05;
Fig. 2B
). But contrary to the
 findings for speed improvement, there was no significant change in error rate
 across tests on day 1 (
Fig. 2B
,
 solid black bars; F[4,45] = 1.19,
P
= 0.32) or following sleep,
 across day 2 (
Fig. 2B
, hatched
 bars; F[3,36] = 0.28,
P
= 0.82). This was further confirmed by a
 comparison of the error rate slopes calculated across the four time points on
 days 1 and 2 (
Fig. 2B
; broken
 lines), which also did not differ significantly from each other (t[9] = 1.2,
P
= 0.25), or from zero for each day separately (t[9] < 1.1,
P
> 0.28). However, a comparison of performance at the final
 retest prior to sleep on day 1 (RT3, 10 PM) with the first retest following
 sleep on day 2 (RT4, 10 AM) revealed a large and significant 45.9% reduction
 in the error rate expressly overnight [t(9) = 2.54,
P
= 0.03;
Fig. 2B
].
In summary, sleep resulted in large overnight improvements in speed and
 equally large improvements in error rate. But whereas gains in motor skill
 speed were seen across daytime rehearsal on day 1 but not day 2, there were no
 significant reductions in error rate across the waking interval on either day
 1 or day 2.
Group 2: Motor Skill Learning Across 24 hr (
n
= 10)
Previously, we have demonstrated that a night of sleep resulted in an
 average 18% improvement in motor-skill speed following a single training
 session, shown in groups 5 and 6 (
Fig.
 3
), whereas periods of daytime wake offered no significant
 improvement beyond that expected from rehearsal alone
 (
Walker et al. 2002
).
 Furthermore, although error rates decreased by ∼35% overnight, they also
 showed no improvement across periods of wake
 (
Fig. 3
). For comparative
 purposes, we trained subjects in group 2 at 1 PM, and then retested them once
 24 h later (rather than at 12-h intervals as in our previous study) to confirm
 that a similar degree of overnight motor skill learning was evident at 1 PM
 day 2 (+24 h). At the 24-h retest, following a single training session and one
 night of sleep, subjects' performance speed improved by 17.0% (posttraining =
 22.1 seq/trial versus postsleep = 25.9 seq/trial, t[9] = 4.12,
P
=
 0.002;
Fig. 4A
, top) as their
 error rate decreased by 34.5% (t[9] = 2.72,
P
= 0.02;
Fig. 4A
, bottom).
Figure 3.

 5 and 6, modified from

A,B
) Group 5: Following a single training session
 in the morning, subjects demonstrated no significant change in speed or error
 rate following 12 h of wake (RT1; solid bars) relative to the end of training
 (posttraining; PT). However, following a night of sleep, a significant
 increase in speed and decrease in error rate had developed (RT2; hatched bar).
 (
C,D
) Group 6: Subjects were trained in the evening, and showed
 significant improvements in speed and error rate after only 12 h, following a
 night of sleep (RT1, solid bar), but displayed no further significant
 improvements in speed or error rate with an additional 12 h of wake (RT2,
 hatched bars). Error bars, SEM; (Asterisks) significance (P) compared with

Continued motor-skill learning across 24–72 h with variable training
 and intervening nights of sleep (Groups 2–4). (
A,B
) Group 2:
 Subjects received a single training session on day 1 (1 PM), and demonstrated
 significant increases in speed (
A
) and decreases in error rate
 (
B
) relative to the end of training (PT) when retested 24 h later on
 day 2 (1 PM; RT1), similar to overnight values seen in our earlier findings
 (see
Fig. 3
). (
C,D
)
 Group 3: Subjects performed two consecutive training sessions on day 1 (1 PM).
 Although subjects attained different posttraining (PT) performance levels
 relative to subjects in group 2 due to this second training session, they
 displayed almost identical overnight percentage improvements in speed
 (
C
) and reductions in error rate (
D
) at retest on day 2
 (RT1). (
E,F
) Group 4: Subjects received a single training session as
 in group 2, but were instead retested 72 h later after three intervening
 nights of sleep, and showed larger increases in performance speed (
E
)
 and greater reductions in error rate (
F
). Error bars, SEM;
 (Asterisks) significance (P) compared with previous time point at *<0.05;
 **<0.005.
Thus, the improvements in both speed and accuracy occurring across 24 h in
 group 2 were similar to those reported previously
 (
Walker et al. 2002
) across 12
 h, including a night of sleep in group 6 (speed: t[21] = 1.10,
P
=
 0.28; error rate, t[21] = 1.17, P = 0.25).
Group 3: Motor Skill Learning Across 24 h Following a Double Training
 Session (
n
= 10)
Subjects in group 3 were trained once at 1 PM day 1, but following a 10-min
 rest period, underwent a second training session of an additional 12 trials,
 and were then retested 24 h later, after one night of sleep. Relative to the
 end of their second training session, subjects in group 3 displayed an average
 17.5% improvement in speed (posttraining = 25.3 seq/trial vs. postsleep = 29.7
 seq/trial, t[9] = 7.2,
P
< 0.0001;
Fig. 4B
, top) and a 37.9%
 decrease in relative error rate (t[9] = 2.89,
P
= 0.01;
Fig. 4B
, bottom). The overnight
 learning effects in group 3 were almost identical to those observed in group 2
 following just one training session for both motor skill speed (+17% vs.
 +17.5%; t[18] = 0.28,
P
= 0.77) and error rate (–34.5% vs.
 –37.9%; t[18] = 0.72,
P
= 0.48). Therefore, whereas doubling
 the intensity of initial training did allow some additional
 rehearsal-dependent improvements during Session 2, it did not appear to change
 the subsequent quantity of overnight sleep-dependent learning that
 developed.
Group 4: Motor Skill Learning Across 72 h (
n
= 10)
Subjects in group 4 were trained only once (12 trials) at 1 PM on day 1 as
 in group 2. But instead of being retested 24 h later, following one night of
 sleep, they were retested 72 h later, following three nights of sleep, on day
 4. At the 72-h retest, subjects showed marked improvements in both performance
 speed (+26.2%; t[9] = 6.20,
P
< 0.0001;
Fig. 4C
, top) and error rate
 (–48.3%; t[9] = 2.58,
P
= 0.002;
Fig. 4C
, bottom). Improvements
 seen after three nights of sleep showed trends toward being greater than those
 seen after one night of sleep in group 2 for both speed (+26.2% vs. +17.0%;
 t[18] = 1.96,
P
= 0.07) and error rate (–48.3% vs.
 –34.5%; t[18] = 1.68,
P
= 0.10). This trend toward greater
 speed after three nights of sleep was seen even when compared with subjects
 who received two training sessions rather than one and one night of sleep
 (group 3; speed: t[18] = 2.0,
P
= 0.06).
Training-Dependent Learning Versus Sleep-Dependent Learning
Whereas two stages of motor-skill learning were apparent; one initial rapid
 learning stage during training, and a second phase developing across a night
 of sleep, an outstanding question remained—does the amount of
 training-dependent learning during acquisition (i.e., learning during
 practice) influence or show any relationship with the amount of
 sleep-dependent learning that individuals subsequently achieve? To investigate
 this possibility, the percentage of improvement in motor-skill learning across
 training (difference between baseline score and posttraining score) and the
 percentage of delayed sleep-dependent improvement (difference between the
 posttraining score and the retest score following a night of sleep) was
 correlated in the 25 subjects who were trained once on day 1 and retested once
 after a night of sleep on day 2 (groups 2 and 6 combined). Surprisingly, there
 was no evidence of a relationship between the efficiency of within session,
 training-dependent learning, and the amount of subsequent overnight
 sleep-dependent learning (practice-independent) with regards to performance
 speed (r = 0.18,
P
= 0.38;
Fig.
 5A
). Similarly, there was also no sign of a correlation between
 decreases in error rate within the training session compared with the
 reduction in error rate overnight (r = 0.03,
P
= 0.89;
Fig. 5B
). Similarly, no
 relationship between the two learning stages was evident within each of the
 remaining four groups analyzed separately (speed: r < 0.35,
P
<
 0.18; error rate: < 0.37,
P
< 0.17 for each group) or for all
 groups combined (speed: r = 0.07,
P
= 0.56; error rate: r = 0.13,
P
= 0.26).
One possible explanation for this lack of relationship is that both
 performance speed and error rate had simply reached asymptotic levels at the
 end of training and there was no possibility for a correlative match with the
 delayed overnight learning. However, two further analyses demonstrated this
 not to be the case. Firstly, there was still no correlation between the actual
 posttraining values (rather than percent improvement across training) and the
 amount of subsequent delayed sleep-dependent learning (speed: r = 0.19,
P
= 0.19; error rate: r = 0.22,
P
= 0.14). Secondly, when
 the 25 subjects were divided into 2 groups on the basis of posttraining mean
 score for either speed (≤22> seq/trial) or error rate (≤0.12>
 errors/seq), there was no significant difference between the upper and lower
 achievement groups in the amount of subsequent overnight delayed improvement
 that developed (speed: t[23] = 0.79,
P
= 0.43; error rate: t[23] =
 1.61,
P
= 0.12).
Thus, the lack of correlation between practice-dependent learning and
 sleep-dependent learning did not appear to be due to posttraining asymptotic
 levels, and regardless of the performance ability achieved at the end of
 training, high or low, both groups appeared to develop an equal distribution
 of overnight sleep-dependent improvement, unrelated to the prior posttraining
 ability. Taken together, the lack of correlation suggests that the two stages
 of motor skill learning, one training dependent and the other sleep dependent,
 are distinct and independent processes.
DISCUSSION
Differential Motor-Skill Learning Before and After Sleep
Subjects in group 1 were tested repeatedly on the motor-skill task across
 two consecutive days (36 h) separated by an intervening night of sleep.
 Following a single training session in the morning, subjects showed the
 ability for small but continued incremental improvements in speed at each of
 the retest sessions across the first 12 h on day 1 prior to sleep, similar to
 that expected by continued task rehearsal, and without evidence of circadian
 fluctuations (
Fig. 2A
; solid
 bars). When retested immediately after the night of sleep, subjects showed a
 much larger improvement, far in excess of that predicted by additional
 rehearsal and similar to the overnight sleep-dependent improvements seen in
 our previous study (
Fig. 3
;
Walker et al. 2002
). However,
 following these sleep-dependent performance gains, the capacity for additional
 rehearsal-based learning appeared to temporarily stall, with continued
 retesting (rehearsal) across day 2 yielding no further improvements in
 motor-skill speed (
Fig. 2A
,
 hatched bars).
It would therefore appear that the large increase in performance produced
 by a night of sleep comes at the expense of potential improvement with
 rehearsal the next day. But, as discussed below, this diminished learning
 potential does not represent the end of all further improvement. A previous
 report has demonstrated that performance on this task continues to improve
 with repeat testing across many weeks (termed the slow component of learning),
 with subjects achieving greater than 35 seq/trial by week 5 before nearing
 asymptotic levels (
Karni et al.
 1998
), far in excess of values achieved by subjects in this
 study.
Interestingly, error rate scores show a different profile across 36 h. In
 contrast to motor skill speed, no significant change in error rate was seen
 with repeated testing across either day 1 or day 2. The only reduction in
 error rate seen after the initial training session occurred across the
 intervening night of sleep. This is perhaps surprising considering that,
 despite the continued task rehearsals during each brief retest, periods of
 daytime wake still offered no consistent decreases in error rate, regardless
 of whether the waking episode came before or after a night of sleep.
Although not specifically designed to investigate circadian effects on
 motor skill learning, we reiterate that circadian influences are not likely to
 be the explanatory factor determining changes in motor learning observed
 across the 36-h period, for several reasons. Firstly, the profile of
 performance speed across day 1 is dramatically different from that of day 2,
 despite being tested at identical time points on the circadian cycle.
 Similarly, the profile of error rate change across day 1 is completely
 reversed on day 2, even though test times were identical on both days.
 Secondly, the initial learning curves across training were essentially
 identical for subjects trained in the morning, afternoon, and evening.
 Thirdly, the delayed, sleep-dependent learning effect appears to occur only
 across periods of sleep, regardless of whether those sleep epochs occur during
 the day or during the night (
Fischer et al.
 2002
;
Walker et al.
 2002
). Finally, there was no significant difference in subjective
 ratings of alertness across all testing points. Thus, the changes in learning
 profile do not appear to be easily explained by any known profile of circadian
 rhythm, although some subtle influences may yet be identified.
It is therefore clear that a delayed, sleep-dependent learning effect is
 common for both motor-skill speed and error rate. Nevertheless, a subtle
 difference exists. Small practice-dependent improvements in performance speed,
 but not in error rate, are possible during brief retests before the occurrence
 of sleep, although following a night of sleep, further rehearsal offers no
 additional improvement in either speed or error rate.
The small, continued rehearsal-based improvements in motor-skill learning
 with repeat testing across the first day are different from a recent report of
 actual diminishing performance on a visual skill task with repeat daytime
 testing, the effects of which can be ameliorated with a brief period of
 daytime sleep (
Mednick et al.
 2002
). Whereas the cause of this difference remains unclear, we
 consider several potential explanations. Firstly, the duration of retesting on
 these tasks is dramatically different. Retesting on the motor task in this
 study lasted just 3 min, whereas the duration of each retest for the visual
 skill task was >1 h. Such prolonged durations of testing on the visual
 skill task may therefore trigger performance deteriorations across the day. It
 remains to be seen if short retest periods on the visual task provoke a
 similar profile of deterioration. Secondly, these task differences may also
 reflect a distinction between the input (sensory/perceptual) and output
 (motor) roles of each of the respective systems used. From a functional
 perspective, it is conceivable that the motor system simply does not fatigue
 as easily as the visual system.
Sleep-Dependent Learning Following One or Two Training Sessions
Another question regarding the sleep-dependent nature of motor-skill
 learning concerned the amount of initial training during acquisition. Subjects
 in group 2 received only one training session on day 1 and were retested 24 h
 later after a single night of sleep. When subjects in group 3 received a
 second training session on day 1 (10 min after completion of the first
 session), relatively modest increases in motor-skill speed and small
 reductions in error rate continued to develop. Interestingly, this further
 improvement did not diminish the amount of subsequent overnight improvement
 that developed, but neither did it increase the sleep-dependent learning
 effect.
The nearly identical percentages of overnight improvement in these two
 groups (speed: +17.0% vs. +17.5%; error rate: –34.5% vs. –37.9%)
 suggest that the strength or efficiency of memory representation formed after
 one training session is sufficient to maximize subsequent sleep-dependent
 modification, and although a second training session provides some additional
 performance gains within that practice session, it does not alter the amount
 of delayed overnight learning that will subsequently develop.
Sleep-Dependent Learning Across Three Nights of Sleep Versus One
 Night of Sleep
Although the extent of overnight improvement did not differ after one or
 two training sessions, additional nights of posttraining sleep do appear to
 confer additional learning benefits. Subjects in group 4 received a single
 training session on day 1, but instead of being retested after only one night
 of sleep (as in group 2), were retested 72 h later, after three nights of
 sleep, and demonstrated large significant improvements in speed (+26.2%) and
 error rate (–48.3%).
Thus, whereas sleep on the first night following training offered the most
 dramatic learning benefit, subsequent nights of sleep provided more modest but
 continued gains. It is important to note that neither rehearsal nor the simple
 passage of wake time on day 2 led to any increase in speed. Thus, the
 subsequent improvement over additional days and nights would appear to again
 reflect sleep-dependent processes, and emphasize the robust and long-acting
 role that sleep appears to offer, not only for the maintenance of performance
 levels, but for the actual enhancement of learning.
It is of note that the temporal evolution of large gains in motor-skill
 learning immediately after the first night of sleep, followed by more modest
 continued improvements across subsequent nights of sleep, are similar to those
 reported for the time course of sleep-dependent visual skill learning
 (
Stickgold et al. 2000a
). The
 similarity of overnight gains resulting from multiple nights of sleep for
 these different perceptual and motor tasks may indicate a common underlying
 profile of sleep-dependent memory formation within the procedural memory
 domain.
Training-Dependent Learning Versus Sleep-Dependent Learning
In our previous study, we found that the amount of stage-II NREM sleep,
 particularly in the last quarter of the night, could explain more than half of
 the variance in overnight improvement on the motor skill task
 (
Walker et al. 2002
). Another
 obvious factor that could determine the quantity of delayed learning is the
 amount of improvement achieved within the training session. However, although
 subjects all improved substantially across the training session, there was no
 correlation between the amount of learning achieved during training and the
 amount of subsequent sleep-dependent improvement, regardless of the
 posttraining level that individual subjects achieved. These correlations would
 suggest that the sleep-dependent process of improvement is unrelated to the
 practice-dependent process of learning during waking, reflecting two discrete
 stages of procedural memory formation, one developing rapidly during task
 performance and one developing across a night of sleep without active task
 engagement.
Although remaining speculative, it is interesting to note that this
 two-stage learning progression has intriguing parallels with cellular data
 regarding motor-skill learning. Rapid changes in neuronal responsiveness
 within the motor system involving the disinhibition or unmasking of latent
 intracortical connections (
Jacobs and
 Donoghue 1991
;
Butefisch et al.
 2000
) have been demonstrated across the time frame of minutes, and
 may therefore be distinct from more slowly developing changes across hours or
 days that involve alterations in neuronal structure (e.g., synaptic
 connectivity) and function (e.g., synaptic sensitivity)
 (
Soderling and Derkach 2000
;
Abel and Lattal 2001
). It is
 tantalizing to suggest that a similar mechanistic difference underlies the
 independence seen between the rapid, within-session performance changes on our
 finger-tapping task and the more slowly developing, sleep-dependent changes
 that develop overnight.
In summary, it would appear firstly that the overnight motor-skill learning
 that occurs during sleep alters the capacity for subsequent rehearsal-based
 improvements during waking episodes, so that prior to a night of sleep, small
 practice-dependent gains are possible, but following a night of sleep, this
 capacity is diminished. Secondly, doubling the duration of training does not
 appear to alter the amount of subsequent sleep-dependent learning.
 Furthermore, the amount of sleep-dependent learning does not correlate with
 the amount of practice-dependent learning during training, suggesting the
 existence of two discrete motor-learning processes. Finally, whereas the
 majority of sleep-dependent motor-skill learning appears to occur during the
 first night of sleep following training, additional nights of sleep appear to
 support continued improvements.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The study cohort consisted of 40 right-handed subjects between the ages of
 18 and 28 (mean age 24.3 ±2.1[SD]; 23 females). Subjects had no prior
 history of drug or alcohol abuse, neurological, psychiatric, or sleep
 disorders, and were instructed to be drug, alcohol, and caffeine free for 24 h
 prior to and during the study period. All studies were approved by the local
 human studies committee and all subjects provided written informed
 consent.
Procedural Motor-Skill Task
The sequential finger-tapping task required subjects to press four numeric
 keys on a standard computer keyboard with the fingers of their left
 (nondominant) hand, repeating the five-element sequence, 4-1-3-2-4, as quickly
 and as accurately as possible, for a period of 30 sec. The numeric sequence
 (4-1-3-2-4) was displayed at the top of the screen at all times to exclude any
 working memory component to the task. Each key press produced a white dot on
 the screen, forming a row from left to right and back, rather than the numbers
 typed, so as not to provide accuracy feedback. The computer recorded the key
 press responses, and each 30-sec trial was scored for the number of complete
 sequences achieved, designated as speed, and the number of errors made
 relative to the number of sequences (errors/sequence), designated as error
 rate. One single training session consisted of 12 30-sec trials with 30-sec
 rest periods between trials, and lasted a total of 12 min. The scores (speed
 and error rate) from the first trial of the training session were taken as the
 baseline measure, whereas the averaged scores from the final three trials were
 defined as the posttraining performance. At each subsequent retest, subjects
 performed three 30-sec trials of the same sequence separated by 30-sec rest
 periods, with the scores again being averaged.
Experimental Groups
The 40 subjects were divided into 4 experimental groups of 10 subjects
 each, and were trained at either 10 AM or 1 PM Day 1. Each group subsequently
 underwent a specific schedule of retests. All training and test sessions were
 performed within 30 min of the times indicated, and morning retests were
 performed at least 1 h after awakening. The testing schedules, shown in
Figure 6
, were as follows:
Figure 6.
Experimental protocols. Forty subjects (groups 1–4) were trained at
 either 10 AM or 1 PM on day 1, and then retested across the following
 24–72-h period in different experimental protocols. Thirty additional
 subjects (groups 5 and 6) were trained and retested in an earlier study
 (
Walker et al. 2002
) and are
 presented for comparison. (TR) Training; (RT) retest
Group 1: Motor-Skill Learning Across 36 h (n
= 10)
Subjects received one training session (12 trials) at 10 AM day 1, and were
 retested at 4-h intervals across the rest of day 1 (4–12 h
 posttraining), and then retested, again at 4-h intervals on day 2 (24–36
 h posttraining) following a night of sleep.
Group 2: Motor-Skill Learning Across 24 h (n
= 10)
Subjects received one training session (12 trials) at 1 PM on day 1 and
 were retested once, 24 h later (1 PM, day 2), following one night of
 intervening sleep. This group served primarily as a control for groups 3 and
 4.
Group 3: Motor-Skill Learning Across 24 h Following a Double
 Training Session (n
= 10)
Subjects received two training sessions (2 × 12 trials), separated by
 a 10-min rest, at 1 PM on day 1, and were retested 24 h later (1 PM, day 2)
 following one night of intervening sleep.
Group 4: Motor-Skill Learning Across 72 h (n
= 10)
Subjects received one training session (12 trials) at 1 PM on day 1, and
 were retested 72 h later (1 PM, Day 4), following three nights of intervening
 sleep.
We also describe relevant data from our previous study (see
Walker et al. 2002
for
 details). These data are for two groups of subjects.
Group 5: Motor-Skill Learning Across 24 h, With Wake First
 (n
= 15)
Subjects received one training session (12 trials) at 10 AM on day 1 and
 were retested (2 trials) 12 h later that same day (10 PM) and again 24 h after
 training (10 AM, day 2), after a night of sleep.
Group 6: Motor-Skill Learning Across 24 h, With Sleep First
 (n
= 15)
Subjects received one training session (12 trials) at 10 PM on day 1 and
 retested (2 trials) 12 hrs later (10 AM, day 2) after a night of sleep, and
 again 24 h after training (10 PM, day 2).
With these additional 30 subjects, data are reported for a total of 70
 subjects.
Sleep Quality and Alertness
At each training and retesting point, all subjects completed the Stanford
 Sleepiness Scale, a standard measure of subjective alertness
 (
Hoddes et al. 1973
). There
 were no significant differences in the Stanford Sleepiness Scale ratings of
 alertness within any of the groups across test points (
P
≥ 0.35
 for each). On the 7-point scale (1 being most alert), mean values were as
 follows: 10 AM–2.48, 1 PM–1.89, 2 PM–2.20, 6 PM–2.33,
 10 PM–2.32.
The amount of overnight sleep obtained by subjects in each group was
 documented with sleep logs, and averaged 7.82 ± 0.72 h (SD) of sleep
 across experimental nights.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were carried out with one-way and two-way repeated measures
 ANOVA's and paired and unpaired two-tailed Students t-tests. All correlations
 between experimental variables were performed using Pearson's correlation
 analyses.
