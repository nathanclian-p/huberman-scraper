Often, there is little regard for the impact of sleep and circadian disruptions in society's attitude towards the organisation of our typical working day. Disturbances to the sleep/wake system that impair daily functioning leading to reduced health are prevalent, with around two thirds of the UK's adult population (67%) reporting some sort of sleep issue [1], [2]. It is well documented that restricted sleep and disrupted circadian rhythmicity result in changes to many physiological processes such as endocrine regulation [3] and core body temperature (CBT) [4], as well as being linked with a variety of health issues, including mood disturbances [5], increased morbidity and mortality rates [6], and declines in cognitive and physical performance [7]. Disruption to circadian and sleep/wake processing represents a substantial economic burden on society, primarily through loss of productivity, absenteeism and poor performance [8], and increases the risk of occupational accidents [9]. A major factor influencing these outcomes is a lack of appreciation for individual differences in vulnerability to sleep disruption and circadian misalignment, and a lack of awareness of the extent to which an individual's circadian timing may not align with the normal 09:00 h–17:00 h working day.
Individual differences in biological rhythms are influenced by physiological [10], [11], genetic [12] and behavioural [13] factors. These differences allow the categorisation of individuals according to their circadian timing, with particularly early and late timings often referred to as ‘larks’ and ‘night owls’ (termed Early and Late circadian phenotypes, ECP/LCP, in this study). At their most extreme these differences can result in clinical diagnoses of the circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs), Advanced Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (ASWPD) and Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD), which are more prevalent in older and younger subjects, respectively. The extent to which these clinical disorders overlap in terms of mechanisms with extreme circadian phenotypes in the healthy population remains unknown.
DSWPD is often associated with mood disorders such as depression [14], and this group of individuals also tend to be restricted by social factors such as work/school routines which shorten sleep resulting in an accumulation of ‘sleep debt’. This causes excessive sleepiness during the day and impairment of cognitive functioning [15]. While clinical assessment is needed to diagnose DSPWD, many of its symptoms are shared with ‘night owls’ (LCPs). LCPs are categorized based on late sleep/wake timings, a delay in dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and/or defective sleep homeostasis [16]. LCPs have been associated with higher scores for depression [17], decreased morning cognitive performance, excessive daytime sleepiness [18], variations in brain connectivity [ADD REF - Facer-Childs ER, Campos BM, Middleton B, Skene DJ, Bagshaw AP. Circadian phenotype impacts the brain's resting state functional connectivity, attentional performance and sleepiness. Sleep. 2019 Feb 15.], as well as increased morbidity and mortality rates [6]. Diurnal variations in both cognitive and physical performance measures have also been shown to vary between circadian phenotypes [19], with LCPs often having difficulties fitting into traditional working hours. Since around 50% of a given population would fall into a ‘Late type’ category (waking after 8:18 h) [20], one could propose that these individuals are compromised by having delayed circadian timing and could benefit by being shifted towards an earlier pattern.
Resetting biological clocks can be achieved using behavioural methods, pharmacological methods or a combination of the two. The human circadian system is responsive to light, which allows sleep/wake activity and physiology to adapt to the 24 h light dark cycle. As a result, light, or lack of light, is a major target to try and reset biological clocks through a process called photic entrainment. Bright light has been shown to shift circadian phase depending on time and duration of light administered (phase response curve) [21], [22]. Exposure in the early morning phase advances the circadian system causing DLMO to peak earlier and sleep onset to become advanced [23]. Conversely, light exposure during the biological night creates a phase delay shown by a later DLMO [24], [25].
Non photic forms of entrainment have also been researched to try and shift circadian phase [26]. These behavioural targets (ie, non-pharmacological interventions) include altering sleep/wake cycles [27], timed physical exercise [28] and timed feeding [29]. Timed feeding has been shown to shift peripheral clocks in mice without affecting the SCN clock [30]. Furthermore, timed feeding has been shown to regulate peripheral metabolic rhythms with a 5-h delay in meal timings delaying rhythms of plasma glucose and adipose PER2 clock gene expression [29]. An alternative circadian zeitgeber that has been explored is targeted physical exercise. Timed exercise can alter the rhythm of core body temperature [31] and melatonin [32]. A recent paper has further supported these findings, showing that exercise in the morning and early afternoon elicits a phase advance, whereas scheduled evening exercise causes a phase delay [33].
The majority of our society has stringent work and schooling hours requiring attendance between the hours of 09:00 h and 17:00 h. Despite these traditional imposed social clock requirements, there has been some shift towards understanding biological constraints by allowing flexibility of working hours [34], as well as attempts to move school start times to fit to adolescents' notoriously late running biological clocks [35]. However, despite awareness of the consequences, there is still a long way to go to directly translate research outcomes and affect change in our rapidly evolving ‘round the clock’ society.
Although attempting a phase advance (shifting the clock earlier) using some of these methods has previously been shown in laboratory studies [28], [36], [37], field studies are lacking. Furthermore, investigating the impact on mental health and diurnal variations in performance have not yet been attempted in real world settings. Here we propose a novel intervention strategy for LCPs, many of whom suffer from chronic circadian misalignment or disrupted sleep homeostasis. Using simple, practical lifestyle changes, we aimed to phase advance sleep/wake timings, DLMO and time of peak cortisol awakening response. We hypothesised that if a phase advance is achieved this would improve self-rated measures of mental health (depression, anxiety and stress) as well as shift the timing of peak performance earlier, and thus improve simple indices of cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance at non-optimum times of day.
