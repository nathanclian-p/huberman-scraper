The Best I’ve Ever Felt
I’ve never felt more focused, more energetic, more calm, and more patient with people. All it takes is making the decision to do and feel your best, hit that button, and get Zero.
The Most Used and Best App I Have on My Phone
Zero is the best app that I have on my phone. It’s helped me so much with my weight and fitness goals — truly a life-changing app. Thank you so much!
Terrific App
I love Zero. Deceptively simple to use, with complex science solidly backing it. This has become a lifestyle choice for both my wife and I — and we are loving the health benefits from it already.
Love Zero
This is a great app. Very user-friendly, and I love that it checks in on you to see how you are doing, keeping you accountable. It’s two thumbs up for me!
Keeps Me on Track!
I have really enjoyed the Zero app! It’s nice to see my accomplishments and progress. I enjoy the articles, too! Thanks for making this app accessible and so easy to use!
It’s Super Helpful
This app has been essential in my weight loss journey. Reading about the different phases my body goes through has also helped keep me motivated.
Fantastic App!
Very well designed, with great tools for motivation (like streak tracking, badges, etc.) and education (like numerous articles). The fasting Timer and notifications are great.
Fantastic — Easy to Use and Easy to Log and Track
Best investment which helped me get my weight down. Live a healthy life and fast to improve my focus, energy, and mood. I eat a lot healthier and have lost 50 pounds.
Easy to Use
Simple and easy to use. Don’t have to get lost on metrics. It’s helped me control late-night binging. Love the fact that you can end your fast from the watch.
Zero Helped Me Lose 100 lbs and Counting
I cannot thank the Zero team enough for creating this well-polished app. Zero, along with a healthy ketogenic diet, helped me lose over 100 lbs — and still going strong!
Really Helpful and Easy to Use
I love this app. It is really worth every penny. I am moving forward on my health goals, and I am more informed now than ever about fasting and getting results. I love it!
