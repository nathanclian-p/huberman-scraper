Abstract
Aim:
We examined whether cold water swimming for seven consecutive months changes basal leptin and insulin concentrations and insulin sensitivity in healthy non-obese women.
Materials and methods:
Fourteen recreational female swimmers aged 45 ± 8.7 years, regularly swimming outdoors during winter months were exposed to cold water at least twice a week. Fasting blood samples were collected in October, January and April. Serum leptin, insulin and glucose concentrations were tested and insulin sensitivity was calculated using updated model HOMA2.
Results:
Repeated cold water baths significantly increased insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin and leptin concentrations (
p
= 0.006,
p
= 0.032,
p
= 0.042, respectively). Leptin concentration positively correlated with body-mass index (BMI) and insulin level (
r
= 0.412,
r
= 0.868, respectively). Insulin level inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity and positively with glucose (
r
= −0.893,
r
= 0.166, respectively). No associations between leptin and insulin sensitivity were found.
Conclusion:
Regular cold water swimming may stimulate metabolic changes suggesting that leptin and insulin participate in adaptive metabolic mechanisms triggered by repeated cold exposure accompanied by mild exercise in healthy non-obese women.
