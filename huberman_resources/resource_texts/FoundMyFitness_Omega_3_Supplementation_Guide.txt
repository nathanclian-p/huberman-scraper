Omega-3 fatty acids exert a multitude of effects on health and aging, including:
reducing DNA damage, oxidative stress, and muscle loss
in older adults;
preventing age-related macular degeneration
and
improving night vision
; and reducing ischemic events, including cardiovascular death,
by as much as 25%
. But the fact is many people aren't getting adequate amounts of omega-3s — and the health consequences are plenty. In fact, individuals with an omega-3 index of 8% or more have a
5-year increased life expectancy
compared to people with a 4% omega-3 index.
