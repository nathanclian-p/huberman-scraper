"""
Brain Energy
is a dramatic breakthrough in understanding mental illness by a leading Harvard psychiatrist who provides a revolutionary road map for people suffering from depression, anxiety, bipolar disease, in fact, almost any brain disorder.""

""
Brain Energy
provides a long-awaited unifying mechanism underlying a vast spectrum of mental illness conditions. And this new paradigm will undoubtedly usher in potent therapeutic interventions for pervasive psychiatric conditions for which standard pharmaceutical approaches have proven minimally effective.""

Grain Brain
""Dr. Palmer takes a provocative and insightful look into the origins of mental disorders, which have profound implications for how we treat the disease . . . and for our diet.""

bestselling author of
Live Life in the Fasting Lane
""Not since the foundational theories of psychodynamics (Sigmund Freud) and behaviorism (John Watson) has a bold and potentially transformative new proposition emerged to explain the mounting epidemic of mental illness throughout the world and across the age-span. Dr. Palmer's ground-breaking theory is that abnormalities in brain energy metabolism are likely root causes of psychiatric conditions and that dietary and metabolic approaches can be exploited to benefit patients, and even the general population at large.""

""
Brain Energy
calls for a much-needed revolution in how we think about and treat mental illnesses. This book integrates decades of science in mitochondrial biology with clinical experience to provide a rational theory for the origin of common psychiatric conditions, carving a path towards better mental health.""

""After a bipolar episode at age 19, our son was seen by more than forty mental health practitioners and prescribed twenty-nine different medications. But it was not until he started on a ketogenic metabolic therapy under the guidance of Dr. Chris Palmer that he got his mind and his life back. Dr. Palmer's metabolic approach has the potential to radically impact the world's mental health epidemic.""

""Psychiatry will never be the same . . . Christopher Palmer poses the hypothesis, supports it with data, and in my humble opinion nails the treatment—feed the brain what it needs.""
—Robert H. Lustig, MD, MSL, emeritus professor of pediatrics at UCSF and author of
Metabolical
""If you have ever been dissatisfied with the rather hard-to-defend explanations of mental illness, this groundbreaking book is for you . . . An exhilarating intellectual journey to reveal the new beginnings of psychiatry.""
—Zoltán Sarnyai, MD, PhD, professor and head of the Laboratory of Psychiatric Neuroscience, James Cook University, Australia
""Dr. Christopher Palmer has written a must-read primer for anyone considering understanding and treating mental health. The book will guide you to understand why metabolism and mitochondria are fundamental to keep your brain healthy . . . a call to action to transform mental health treatment.""
—Ana C. Andreazza, PhD, professor of pharmacology and psychiatry, University of Toronto and founder and scientific director, Mitochondrial Innovation Initiative
""Dr. Palmer is uncanny in his synthesizing extant literature and providing a prescient thesis on the pathoetiologic and potentially therapeutic role of metabolics of neuropsychiatric conditions. The thesis and framework proffered by Dr. Palmer provides for many prevention and therapeutic opportunities in psychiatry and take us one step closer to disease-modifying possibilities.""
—Roger S. McIntyre, MD, FRCPC, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, Canada
""
Brain Energy
is a book that cannot be read and incorporated into policy soon enough: mental disorders are an accelerating crisis, especially among children. This is not rocket science, it's neuroscience.""

""Kudos to Dr. Chris Palmer for penning a thought-provoking and superb book on the revolutionary breakthroughs occurring in psychiatry, a discipline in medicine that has suffered far too long and from too much stigma.""
—Sanjiv Chopra, MBBS, MACP, FRCP, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and bestselling author
""It is clear to me from clinical practice that what we eat and drink affects our brain function and mental health but I never understood why. Dr. Palmer brilliantly connects the dots to explain why this is true.""
—Eric C. Westman, MD MHS, director of the Duke Keto Medicine Clinic
""
Brain Energy
is a book all psychiatric professionals should read as a useful criticism of our field's major deficits. It is a book all people should read to understand how much they can do (and not do) for the sake of their mental health. Basic health is self-evident but takes courage to commit to taking exquisite care of your body and by extension your brain.""

""Dr. Palmer's
Brain Energy
seemed to take me by the hand and gently walk me through the most complex of medical journeys—arriving at the most fascinating yet incredibly logical conclusions. Though not a scientist, I was able to follow and actually become riveted during every step of the journey.""
—Jim Abrahams, director of The Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies
""
Brain Energy
, by Dr Chris Palmer, is THE much-needed new perspective on mental health that could revolutionize the way we think about, research, and treat mental health conditions . . . Filled with brilliant analogies, jaw-dropping statistics, fascinating scientific details, and moving patient stories, this book is an absolute must-read.""

About the Author
Dr. Christopher M. Palmer
is a Harvard psychiatrist and researcher working at the interface of metabolism and mental health. He has developed the first comprehensive theory of what causes mental illness, integrating existing theories and research into one unifying theory—the brain energy theory of mental illness.
He is the Director of the Department of Postgraduate and Continuing Education at McLean Hospital and an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. For over 25 years, he has conducted neuroscience research and worked with people who have treatment-resistant mental illness using standard treatments. He has been pioneering the use of the medical ketogenic diet in the treatment of psychiatric disorders—conducting research in this area, treating patients, writing, and speaking around the world on this topic. More broadly, he is interested in the roles of metabolism and metabolic interventions on brain health.
