Smita Das, MD, PhD, MPH, has been involved in tobacco research many years. At the time she wrote the article ‘Smoking, nicotine, health, and mental health,’ she was a chief resident in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine with plans to pursue addiction psychiatry. A native of the San Francisco Bay Area, she studied chemistry and statistics at Stanford, completed her Master’s in public health at Dartmouth College, and then completed her MD and PhD in community health at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Throughout her training, she accumulated over a decade of experience, starting in the year 2000, with Dr. C.

Currently, her research areas of interest are addiction-behavior, community outreach, hospital quality, and development/implementation of behavioral interventions in public health. She is heavily involved in research with Dr. Judith Prochaska (coauthor) in the area of public health and psychiatry with a current focus in smoking, addiction, and mental illness in disadvantaged youth and families.
