Emotion regulation (ER) has been defined as the individual’s ability to modulate the experience and expression of positive and negative emotions in accordance with the situational context where they unfold (Gross, 2001; Gross & Thompson, 2007). ER is thought to be critical for the individual’s psychological functioning, as well as for overall adaptation to the physical and social environment (Gross & Munoz, 1995; Gross, 2007). For instance, effective ER has been shown to predict satisfactory social relationships (English, John, & Gross, 2013) as well as enhanced psychological well-being (Balzarotti, Biassoni, Villani, Prunas, & Velotti, 2016; Gross & John, 2003; Haga, Kraft, & Corby, 2009), while problems in emotion regulation have been linked to the development of psychopathological symptoms and emotional disorders (e.g., Gross & Munoz, 1995; Sheppes, Suri, & Gross, 2015).
Extensive psychophysiology research has focused on identifying biomarkers of emotion regulation – changes in physiological activation represent in fact a main emotional response domain (e.g., Levenson, 2003; for a review see Kreibig, 2010; Mauss & Robinson, 2009). In the past two decades, a growing number of studies has stressed the role of
cardiac vagal control
(CVC), which refers to the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) on cardiac chronotropy through the vagus nerve (Grossman, Wilhelm, & Spoerle, 2004; Kimhy et al., 2013, Spangler and Friedman, 2015; Werner et al., 2015). CVC has been typically measured analyzing heart rate variability (HRV, defined as the variation in the time interval between heartbeats; Berntson, Eckberg, Grossman, Kaufmann, & Malik, 1997; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology, 1996) and is thought to mark flexible regulation of autonomic arousal in line with situational demands (Appelhans & Luecken, 2006).
In the next paragraphs, a brief theoretical introduction on emotion regulation is given followed by an overview of the main theories that have been proposed to account for the relationship between CVC and emotional responding. Next, we provide a review of the empirical findings from 135 research studies examining CVC as a marker of emotion regulation.
