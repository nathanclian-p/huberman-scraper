Depression is a chronic and recurrent condition that presents a major public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that approximately 4.4% of the global population suffers from depressive disorder, and ranked depression as the single largest contributor to global disability and non-fatal health loss (WHO, 2017). Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric illness in the United States, and researchers estimate that the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of MDD was 10.4% and 20.6%, respectively (Hasin et al., 2018). Another study based on data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005–2008 reported that among adults, the prevalence of depressive symptoms and severe depression was 22% and 0.6%, respectively (Shim et al., 2011). Depression is an important independent risk factor for many conditions, including coronary heart disease (CHD) (Carney and Freedland, 2017), hypertension (Gangwisch et al., 2010), diabetes (Knol et al., 2006) and suicide (Won et al., 2016). Given considerable negative impacts of depression on society and people, identifying risk factors for depression is a public health priority. It has been suggested that neurobiological, psychological, social, and genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression (Raison et al., 2006). For instance age, sex, ethnicity, family history of mood disorders, and chronic illness have been linked to the risk of depression (Sullivan et al., 2000, Kessler et al., 2003, Clarke and Currie, 2009).
Dietary is another potential modifiable factor for depression (Jacka et al., 2011), and increasing attention has been focused on the role of caffeine–one of the world's most frequently ingested psychoactive substance (Heckman et al., 2010). Approximately 85% of the US population (aged ≥ 2 years) and 73% of U.S. children are reported consuming at least one caffeinated beverage per day (Mitchell et al., 2014) and on a given day (Branum et al., 2014), respectively.
Caffeine is a substance with a bioavailability of nearly 100% being rapidly and completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract (Blanchard and Sawers, 1983a, Blanchard and Sawers, 1983b) and distributed to all areas of the body. It passes through all the biological membranes (e.g., the blood-brain barrier and the placenta) owing to its sufficiently hydrophobic nature (Lachance et al., 1983, Ikeda et al., 1982). Some effects due to the intake of caffeine, includes reduced sleeping hours, accelerated aggression, headache, and increased daytime sleepiness (Kang et al., 2012, Roehrs and Roth, 2008). Although caffeine is a widely consumed substance with prominent effects on the central nervous system (Deslandes et al., 2005), its impact on depression is still less understood.
Several previous studies have investigated the association between caffeine intake and depression, but their findings are conflicting intake. Some studies showed a positive association (Richards and Smith, 2015, Benko et al., 2011, Whalen et al., 2008), whereas others found an inverse or lack of association (Smith, 2009, Lucas et al., 2011, Pham et al., 2014), (James et al., 1989, Ruusunen et al., 2010, Ritchie et al., 2014) in addition to and a J-shaped association (Iranpour et al., 2017). Moreover, prior research has limited sample sizes and solely addressed specific age groups or sex, or patients in clinical settings. Thus, the aim of this report was to investigate the association between caffeine intake and depressive symptoms among in a large, nationally representative sample of US adults.
